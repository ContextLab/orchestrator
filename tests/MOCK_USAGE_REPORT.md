# Mock Usage Report for Orchestrator Tests

## Summary

After a comprehensive search of the test directory, I found extensive use of mocks throughout the test suite. This directly contradicts the project's stated policy against using mock objects and simulated implementations.

## Types of Mock Usage Found

### 1. **Direct Mock Imports**
Found in 38 test files:
- `from unittest.mock import Mock, MagicMock, AsyncMock, patch`

### 2. **Mock Objects Being Used**
- `Mock()` - Basic mock objects
- `MagicMock()` - Mock objects with magic method support
- `AsyncMock()` - Asynchronous mock objects
- `patch()` - Context managers and decorators for patching

### 3. **Test Double Classes**
Several test files implement custom test double classes:
- `TestControlSystem` in `test_orchestrator_comprehensive.py`
- `TestModel` classes in various test files
- Dummy functions (e.g., `dummy_function` in `test_langgraph_adapter.py`)

### 4. **MockModel References**
Multiple snippet test files reference a `MockModel` class from `orchestrator.models.mock_model`, but this class doesn't exist in the codebase:
- `test_snippets_batch_13.py`
- `test_snippets_batch_14.py`
- `test_snippets_batch_15.py`
- `test_snippets_batch_16.py`
- `test_snippets_batch_21.py`

## Files with Heavy Mock Usage

### Critical Files:
1. **test_orchestrator_comprehensive.py**
   - Uses AsyncMock for resource allocator methods
   - Mocks control system capabilities
   - Mocks state manager health checks

2. **test_cache.py**
   - Extensive mocking of Redis cache operations
   - Mocks disk cache operations
   - Uses patch for file system operations

3. **test_web_tools_real.py**
   - Patches DDGS (DuckDuckGo search) library
   - Mocks HTTP responses
   - Despite being named "real", uses extensive mocking

4. **test_integrations_coverage.py**
   - Mocks API clients for Anthropic, Google, OpenAI
   - Creates fake responses for all API calls

5. **Example Tests (tests/examples/)**
   - All 12 example test files use mocks
   - Base class `test_base.py` provides mock fixtures
   - Mock model registry and tool registry

## Specific Mock Patterns

### API Mocking:
```python
mock_client = MagicMock()
mock_response = MagicMock()
mock_response.content = [MagicMock(text="Generated text")]
mock_client.messages.create = AsyncMock(return_value=mock_response)
```

### Resource Mocking:
```python
orchestrator.resource_allocator.get_utilization = AsyncMock(return_value={"cpu": 0.5, "memory": 0.3})
orchestrator.resource_allocator.request_resources = AsyncMock(return_value=True)
```

### File System Mocking:
```python
with patch("shutil.rmtree", side_effect=Exception("Clear failed")):
```

### Health Check Mocking:
```python
model.health_check = AsyncMock(return_value=True)
orchestrator.state_manager.is_healthy = AsyncMock(return_value=False)
```

## Recommendations

According to the project's CLAUDE.md instructions:
> Never use mock objects or tests, even as fallback systems-- if real functionality doesn't work, or if tests can't be validated with real models, real inputs, and real use cases, then they should raise an exception or fail.

To comply with this policy, ALL of these mock usages should be replaced with:
1. Real API calls to actual services
2. Real file system operations
3. Real database operations
4. Real model executions
5. Real network requests

This would require:
- Setting up test accounts for all AI services
- Creating test databases
- Using real Docker containers for sandbox testing
- Making actual web requests
- Implementing real control systems instead of test doubles

## Files That Need Major Refactoring

1. All 59 test files that use mocks
2. Example tests need complete rewrite without mock fixtures
3. Integration tests need to use real integrations
4. Coverage tests need real implementations

Note: The `MockModel` class referenced in snippet tests should either be implemented as a real test model or the tests should be updated to use real models.
