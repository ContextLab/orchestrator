# Climate Change: Current State and Impacts

## Global Temperature Changes

The Earth's average temperature has increased by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. This warming trend has accelerated significantly in recent decades, with the last decade being the warmest on record.

Scientists have observed that Arctic regions are warming nearly twice as fast as the global average, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. This rapid warming has profound implications for global weather patterns and sea level rise.

## Greenhouse Gas Concentrations

Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have reached 420 parts per million as of 2024, the highest concentration in over 3 million years. Methane concentrations have also risen dramatically, reaching 1,900 parts per billion.

The primary sources of these emissions include fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes. Agriculture contributes approximately 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

## Ocean Changes

The world's oceans have absorbed about 93% of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean temperatures have risen by 0.33 degrees Celsius since 1969.

Sea levels are currently rising at a rate of 3.3 millimeters per year globally. Some coastal cities are experiencing even higher rates of sea level rise due to local factors.

Ocean acidification has increased by 30% since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, threatening marine ecosystems and coral reefs worldwide.

## Ice Loss and Glacial Retreat

Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13% per decade. The Greenland ice sheet loses approximately 280 billion tons of ice annually.

Mountain glaciers worldwide have lost more than 9,000 billion tons of ice since 1961. The Himalayan glaciers, which provide water for billions of people, are retreating rapidly.

## Ecosystem Impacts

The Amazon rainforest, often called the "lungs of the Earth," produces about 20% of the world's oxygen. However, deforestation rates have increased by 150% in recent years.

Coral bleaching events have become five times more common than they were 40 years ago. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced unprecedented back-to-back bleaching events.

## Extreme Weather Events

Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, with record-breaking temperatures observed on every continent. The frequency of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has increased by 50% over the past 40 years.

Droughts now affect 55 million people globally each year. Flooding events have increased by 134% since 2000.

## Human Health Impacts

Climate change causes approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress. Air pollution linked to fossil fuel emissions causes 7 million premature deaths annually.

Vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever are expanding their geographic range as temperatures rise.

## Economic Consequences

The global economy loses $1.2 trillion annually due to climate change impacts. Agricultural productivity has declined by 21% since 1961 due to climate change.

Extreme weather events caused $280 billion in damages in 2023 alone. Climate migration could displace 200 million people by 2050.

## Renewable Energy Progress

Solar power capacity has grown by 20% annually over the past decade. Wind energy now provides 10% of global electricity generation.

Electric vehicle sales increased by 60% in 2023, reaching 14 million units sold worldwide. Battery storage costs have decreased by 90% since 2010.

## Policy and Action

Over 70 countries have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Carbon pricing mechanisms now cover 23% of global emissions. Green bonds issued in 2023 exceeded $500 billion for the first time.
