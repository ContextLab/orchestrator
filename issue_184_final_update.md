# Issue #184 - Template Rendering Final Update

## Summary
After extensive debugging, I've identified that the JIT template rendering foundation is working correctly for most pipelines, but there's an issue specific to the `research_advanced_tools.yaml` pipeline.

## Key Findings

### What's Working ✅
1. **research_minimal.yaml** - All templates render correctly
2. **research_basic.yaml** - All templates render correctly
3. Conditional task execution timing is fixed
4. Template dependency analysis is working
5. Template manager is being passed to the filesystem tool

### What's Not Working ❌
1. **research_advanced_tools.yaml** - Templates in the filesystem write step are not being rendered

### Investigation Results
1. The control system correctly identifies filesystem write operations and preserves the content parameter for runtime rendering
2. The `_template_manager` is being passed to the filesystem tool
3. The filesystem tool's `deep_render` method is being called
4. The template manager has the correct context (confirmed via logging)

### Key Differences
The working pipelines (minimal and basic) use simpler template expressions:
- `{{ step_id.result }}` for text results
- `{{ step_id.total_results }}` for counts
- Direct property access on step results

The failing advanced pipeline uses the same syntax but appears to have a different execution context.

### Hypothesis
The issue appears to be related to how step results are structured or registered in the template manager for the advanced pipeline. The user correctly noted we should "detangle model performance differences from template or toolbox errors" - the issue is not with the models but with the template rendering mechanism.

### Commits
- `50577c6` - fix: Ensure conditional task conditions are evaluated after dependencies are satisfied
- `d29b519` - fix: Add debug logging for template rendering in filesystem operations  
- `24fc313` - debug: Add extensive logging and create fixed research_advanced_tools pipeline

### Next Steps
1. Create a unit test that reproduces the exact scenario from research_advanced_tools
2. Debug why the template context differs between pipelines
3. Consider if the issue is related to the execution order or how results are registered
4. Verify that all step result types (dict, string, etc.) are handled consistently

The foundation for JIT template rendering is solid - we just need to resolve this specific edge case with the advanced pipeline.
