# Status Update on ContextManager API Design

## Current Status
The JIT template rendering implementation is nearly complete. I've implemented the core functionality but encountered a specific challenge with conditional tasks.

## What's Working
- Template dependency analysis correctly identifies which step results each template depends on
- Basic pipelines render templates correctly at runtime
- Template metadata is properly tracked through the compilation process
- The filesystem tool correctly handles runtime template rendering for the `write` action

## Current Issue
The main remaining issue is with conditional tasks in `research_advanced_tools.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: extract_content
  condition: "{{ (search_topic.results | length > 0) or (deep_search.results | length > 0) }}"
```

The condition itself contains templates that need to be rendered, but we can't render them until the dependencies (`search_topic` and `deep_search`) complete. This creates a timing issue.

## Proposed Solution
I'm working on deferring condition evaluation for conditional tasks until their dependencies are satisfied. This involves:

1. Checking task dependencies first
2. Only evaluating conditions after dependencies complete
3. Then rendering parameter templates if the condition is true

This aligns with the general principle of JIT rendering - evaluate/render only when you have the necessary context.

## Timeline
The implementation is very close to completion. Once the conditional task issue is resolved, all pipelines should work with proper JIT template rendering.
