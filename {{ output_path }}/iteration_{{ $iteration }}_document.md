## Analysis Summary

The document contains **10 significant factual claims** about climate change, covering:

- **Global temperature trends** (3 claims)
- **Physical environmental changes** (2 claims) 
- **Weather pattern changes** (2 claims)
- **Ecological impacts** (2 claims)
- **General scientific observations** (1 claim)

### Key Findings:

1. **No References Found**: None of the factual claims in this document include citations, references, or source URLs
2. **High-Impact Claims**: The document makes several specific quantitative claims (1.1Â°C temperature increase, 13% Arctic ice decline rate, 20cm sea level rise) that would typically require scientific citations
3. **Reference Gap**: With 0% of claims being referenced, this document lacks the scientific backing typically expected for climate change assertions

### Recommendations:

This document would benefit significantly from adding proper scientific references, particularly for the specific numerical claims about temperature changes, sea ice decline rates, and sea level rise measurements., <orchestrator.core.template_manager.TemplateManager.register_context.<locals>.ResultWrapper object at 0x13d7551f0>, and I don't see any claims provided in your request. You mentioned "these unreferenced claims" but no actual claims were included in the data section.

Please provide the specific claims you'd like me to find sources and citations for, and I'll research reliable sources to support each one with proper formatting including URLs, titles, and explanations. appear to be empty or not populated with actual content.

To update a document with proper citations and references, I would need:

1. The original document content
2. The claims analysis identifying unreferenced statements
3. The reference verification results showing which URLs are broken
4. The new citations that were found for unreferenced claims

Please provide the actual document and analysis data so I can complete the citation and reference updates you've requested.
