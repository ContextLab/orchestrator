## Description

Create a new OutputSanitizer class to remove conversational markers and other unwanted content from pipeline outputs. This task involves:

1. Creating an OutputSanitizer class that can identify and remove conversational markers
2. Implementing pattern matching for common conversational phrases
3. Integrating the sanitizer into the pipeline output processing
4. Ensuring clean, professional outputs without conversational artifacts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OutputSanitizer class is implemented with clear interface
- [ ] Removes conversational markers like "Certainly!", "Here is...", etc.
- [ ] Handles hard-coded values that should be computed dynamically
- [ ] Preserves legitimate content while removing unwanted artifacts
- [ ] Can be easily integrated into existing pipeline workflows
- [ ] Includes comprehensive pattern matching for common issues

## Files Affected

- New OutputSanitizer class file
- Pipeline output processing modules
- Integration points in existing pipelines
- Test files for the new functionality

## Implementation Notes

- Use regular expressions for pattern matching
- Consider configurable sanitization rules
- Maintain performance for large outputs
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing pipelines
- Make the sanitizer extensible for future pattern additions

## Testing Requirements

- Test removal of various conversational markers
- Verify legitimate content is preserved
- Test performance with large outputs
- Validate integration with existing pipelines
- Test edge cases and corner scenarios

## Definition of Done

- OutputSanitizer class is fully implemented and tested
- Integration with pipeline output processing is complete
- All tests pass including edge cases
- Documentation includes usage examples
- Code review completed and approved
