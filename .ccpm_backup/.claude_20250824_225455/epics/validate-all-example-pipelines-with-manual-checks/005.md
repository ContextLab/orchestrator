# Task: Add automated issue detection for common problems

## Description
Implement automated detection systems for common quality issues in pipeline outputs including template artifacts, debug statements, conversational markers, formatting problems, and incomplete outputs. The system should automatically flag these issues, categorize them by severity, and provide specific location information for remediation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detection patterns defined for all common issue types
- [ ] Issue severity classification (Critical/Major/Minor/Warning)
- [ ] Line-level issue location tracking for text outputs
- [ ] Integration with quality scoring (automatic point deductions)
- [ ] Issue report generation with actionable feedback
- [ ] Performance optimized for large outputs

## Technical Details
- **Issue types to detect**:
  - Template artifacts: `{{variable}}`, `{%...%}`, unrendered Jinja2
  - Debug output: print statements, console.log, debug flags
  - Conversational markers: "Certainly!", "Here is...", "I'll help you..."
  - Formatting issues: Excessive whitespace, broken markdown, malformed JSON
  - Incomplete outputs: Truncated content, missing sections, partial execution
  - Quality issues: Lorem ipsum, placeholder text, TODO markers
- **Detection implementation**:
  - Regex patterns for text analysis
  - AST parsing for code outputs
  - JSON/YAML validation for structured data
  - Image metadata checking for visual outputs
- **Issue tracking structure**:
  ```python
  {
    "issue_type": "template_artifact",
    "severity": "major",
    "location": {"line": 42, "column": 15},
    "content": "{{undefined_variable}}",
    "suggestion": "Variable 'undefined_variable' not resolved"
  }
  ```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (scoring system for integration)
- [ ] Regular expression library
- [ ] OutputSanitizer patterns for reference

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M (Medium)
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: true (independent detection system)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All detection patterns implemented
- [ ] Issue classification system working
- [ ] Location tracking accurate
- [ ] Integration with scoring complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarked (<1s per file)
- [ ] Unit tests for all detectors
