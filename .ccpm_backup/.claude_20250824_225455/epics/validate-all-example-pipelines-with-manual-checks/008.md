# Task: Execute full validation cycle on all pipelines

## Description
Run the complete validation framework on all 41 example pipelines, including automated execution, quality scoring, issue detection, manual review using checklists, and report generation. This task represents the first production run of the validation system and will establish the quality baseline for all pipelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 41 pipelines executed successfully or with documented failures
- [ ] Quality scores calculated for each pipeline
- [ ] Automated issues detected and documented
- [ ] Manual review checklists completed for each pipeline
- [ ] Visual outputs reviewed and screenshots captured where needed
- [ ] Comprehensive reports generated at all levels
- [ ] Quality baseline established with metrics

## Technical Details
- **Execution plan**:
  1. Pre-validation setup (environment, API keys, test data)
  2. Batch execution with progress tracking
  3. Automated scoring and issue detection
  4. Manual review phase with checklists
  5. Visual output verification
  6. Report generation and aggregation
  7. Baseline metrics calculation
- **Pipelines to validate**: All 41 in examples/ directory
- **Test inputs**: Use standardized test data from examples/data/
- **Manual review allocation**:
  - Data processing: 10 pipelines (~1 hour)
  - Research: 8 pipelines (~1 hour)
  - Creative: 5 pipelines (~30 min)
  - Control flow: 8 pipelines (~30 min)
  - Integration: 5 pipelines (~30 min)
  - Other: 5 pipelines (~30 min)
- **Output location**: `examples/outputs/validation/baseline/`

## Dependencies
- [ ] All framework tasks (001-007) completed
- [ ] API credits available (~$50)
- [ ] Manual reviewer availability (4 hours)
- [ ] Test data prepared

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 8 hours (4 automated, 4 manual)
- Parallel: false (requires complete framework)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All pipelines validated
- [ ] Quality scores recorded
- [ ] Issues documented and categorized
- [ ] Manual reviews complete
- [ ] Reports generated and reviewed
- [ ] Baseline metrics documented
