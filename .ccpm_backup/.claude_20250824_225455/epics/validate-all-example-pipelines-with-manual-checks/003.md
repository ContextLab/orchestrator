# Task: Create quality assessment rubrics and scoring logic

## Description
Develop detailed quality assessment rubrics for each pipeline category (data processing, research, creative, control flow, integration, interactive) with specific scoring criteria. Implement automated scoring logic that can evaluate common quality indicators programmatically while flagging items that require manual review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Category-specific rubrics defined for 6 pipeline types
- [ ] Scoring criteria documented with point allocations
- [ ] Automated checks implemented for measurable quality aspects
- [ ] Manual review flags for subjective quality aspects
- [ ] Rubric configuration files in JSON/YAML format
- [ ] Scoring logic handles partial scores and missing data gracefully

## Technical Details
- **Rubric categories**:
  - Data Processing: Data integrity, transformation accuracy, output format
  - Research: Source quality, content synthesis, citation accuracy
  - Creative: Visual quality, style consistency, prompt adherence
  - Control Flow: Logic correctness, flow execution, error handling
  - Integration: API success, data exchange, error recovery
  - Interactive: User experience, response quality, state management
- **Automated checks**:
  - Template artifact detection ({{variable}}, {%...%})
  - Debug output detection (print statements, console.log)
  - Conversational marker detection ("Certainly!", "Here is...")
  - Structure validation (expected sections present)
  - Output size/length validation
- **Configuration location**: `validation/rubrics/`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (quality scoring system foundation)
- [ ] OutputSanitizer patterns for detection
- [ ] Existing pipeline categorization

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M (Medium)
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on scoring system)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 6 category rubrics created and documented
- [ ] Automated scoring logic implemented
- [ ] Configuration files created and validated
- [ ] Manual review flags system working
- [ ] Unit tests for scoring logic
- [ ] Rubric documentation for reviewers
