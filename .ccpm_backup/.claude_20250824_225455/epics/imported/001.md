# reconfigure and remix examples

**GitHub Issue:** [#214](https://github.com/ContextLab/orchestrator/issues/214)
**Status:** OPEN

## Description

the examples (examples/*.yaml) are mostly working at this point. (and hopefully, by the time we get to this issue, they will *all* be working!) however, most of the examples aren't actually interesting. they could be moved to tutorials, but they shouldn't be showcased as exciting examples of what this toolbox can do.

instead, we should go back to the pipelines from issue #8.  instead of using those original pipelines, which were all broken, let's "remix" the existing working examples to accomplish the intended tasks of each of those pipelines from issue #8.

for *all* examples, we need to:
- [ ] ensure that all relevant tools are fully documented in the sphinx documentation and tutorials. make sure syntax in the tutorial is 100% accurate and functional by MANUALLY verifying that it works and produces the expected outputs/actions/results
- [ ] support the scripts/run_pipeline.py "-o" flag so that we can specify the output directory. We also need a CLI for interacting with that run_pipeline script. it should support the -o flag for specifying output location for results (defaulting to examples/outputs/<pipeline name>), along with additional options for prioritizing speed (small/fast models), local models vs. cloud based models, preferring specific model classes or providers (and/or specific models), and --checkpoint-location for specifying location of checkpoints (default checkpoints/). we also need to add pytests and documentation for the CLI. (note: make this a separate issue if needed.)
- [ ] use intelligent file names based on the task/prompt, as in the creative_image_pipeline example
- [ ] avoid any hard-coded values; everything should be computed from real data or real inputs
- [ ] run several example inputs and manually examine the outputs, for several *interesting* and *creative* examples that demonstrate real-world utility and deep functionality.  look for quality control issues like unrendered templates, incorrect behavior, presence of conversational text, hard-coded values, incorrect values, cut-off text, formatting issues, or any other issue that affects quality.

then update the documentation related to examples to "showcase" (in cards or similar) in the sphinx documentation the different examples. organize them by theme so that they're easy to sort through, and provide links to example outputs.
