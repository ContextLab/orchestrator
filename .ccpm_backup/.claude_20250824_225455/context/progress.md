- **Repository**: https://github.com/ContextLab/orchestrator.git
- **Git Status**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Last Activity**: Active development with recent commits

## Recent Work Completed

### Latest Commits
1. **WIP: Issue #219** - Partial implementation of while loop variable template resolution
2. **Fix: Issue #219** - Added iteration variables to while loop context for template rendering
3. **Backup** - Saved state before implementing Issue #219 (while loop variable template resolution)
4. **Test** - Added comprehensive tests for fact-checker pipeline
5. **Feature** - Working fact-checker implementation (simplified version)
6. **Fix: Issue #172** - Added RecursionControlTool support
7. **Fix** - Video processing now extracts real frames correctly
8. **Feature** - Complete real multimodal processing implementation
9. **Feature** - Implemented real multimodal processing with OpenCV and librosa

## Active Development Areas

### Template System Enhancement
- Working on while loop variable template resolution (Issue #219)
- Improving context variable handling in control flow structures
- Enhanced template rendering capabilities

### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test coverage for fact-checker pipeline
- Multiple test pipelines in active use (control flow, templates, filesystem operations)
- Test files for various pipeline features present in root directory

### Multimodal Processing
- Recent implementation of real multimodal processing
- Video frame extraction functionality
- Integration with OpenCV and librosa for media processing

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Complete Issue #219 - While loop variable template resolution
2. Test and validate the fact-checker implementation
3. Ensure all template variables are properly resolved in control flow contexts

### Medium Priority
1. Review and optimize multimodal processing performance
2. Expand test coverage for new features
3. Update documentation for recent implementations

### Low Priority
1. Code cleanup and refactoring opportunities
2. Performance optimizations for large pipelines
3. Enhanced error handling in edge cases

## Known Issues
- Issue #219: While loop variable template resolution (in progress)
- Issue #172: RecursionControlTool support (recently fixed, needs validation)

## Development Environment
- Python 3.11+ project
- Active use of Claude Code PM system
- Checkpoint system in use for version control
- Multiple test and example pipelines available

## Testing Status
- Test suite includes integration tests, unit tests, and pipeline tests
- Recent focus on fact-checker pipeline testing
- Various YAML test configurations in root directory

## Dependencies
- Core framework dependencies managed through pyproject.toml
- Recent additions for multimodal processing (OpenCV, librosa)
- LangChain integration for structured outputs
