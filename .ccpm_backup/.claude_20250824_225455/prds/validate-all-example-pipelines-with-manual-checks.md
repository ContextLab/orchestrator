# PRD: validate-all-example-pipelines-with-manual-checks

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a comprehensive validation framework that extends beyond automated testing to include manual quality checks, human verification, and systematic evaluation of all 41+ example pipelines in the orchestrator project. The framework will ensure that every pipeline not only executes successfully but also produces high-quality, appropriate, and complete outputs that meet user expectations.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
While automated validation can verify that pipelines compile and execute without errors, it cannot assess:
- Output quality and appropriateness
- Visual correctness of generated images, charts, and reports
- Contextual accuracy of AI-generated content
- User experience and output usability
- Edge case handling and error recovery behavior

### Why is this important now?
- Recent pipeline fixes (Epic #234) resolved technical issues but output quality needs verification
- Users rely on example pipelines as templates for production use
- Documentation claims certain capabilities that need manual verification
- Quality regressions can occur without human oversight
- New pipelines are regularly added without comprehensive validation

## User Stories
