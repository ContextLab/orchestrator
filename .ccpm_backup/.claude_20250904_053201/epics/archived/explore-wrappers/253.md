# Task 003: Deep Agents Evaluation

## Objective
Assess the feasibility of enhancing orchestrator control flow capabilities using LangChain Deep Agents through isolated proof-of-concept development and comprehensive evaluation.

## Scope
Create isolated proof-of-concept for LangChain Deep Agents integration and evaluate potential control flow enhancements.

## Key Requirements

### Primary Goals
- Create isolated proof-of-concept implementation
- Evaluate control flow enhancement opportunities
- Assess production readiness and integration complexity
- Develop comprehensive implementation plan

### Technical Specifications
- **Approach**: Isolated proof-of-concept (separate from main codebase)
- **Framework**: LangChain Deep Agents
- **Focus**: Control flow enhancements and agent-based orchestration
- **Evaluation**: Performance, complexity, maintenance, and integration assessment

### Deliverables
1. Isolated proof-of-concept implementation
2. Comprehensive feasibility assessment report
3. Performance benchmarks and comparison analysis
4. Integration complexity assessment
5. Production readiness evaluation
6. Implementation plan with timeline and resource requirements

## Implementation Notes
- Build proof-of-concept in separate directory/environment
- Test with realistic orchestrator scenarios
- Compare against existing control flow mechanisms
- Assess learning curve and maintenance requirements
- Evaluate impact on existing pipeline architecture

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Proof-of-concept successfully implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive feasibility assessment completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks available
- [ ] Integration complexity documented
- [ ] Clear go/no-go recommendation provided
- [ ] Implementation plan ready (if recommended)
