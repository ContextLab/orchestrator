# Stream C: Quality Reporting & Analytics

## Scope
- Quality control reporting with metrics, analytics, and trend analysis
- Alerting system for quality threshold breaches
- Quality dashboard for monitoring and insights interface

## Files
`src/orchestrator/quality/reporting/`, analytics and dashboards

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED** - All Stream C components implemented and tested

### Completed Components

#### 1. Metrics Collection System (`metrics.py`)
- **QualityMetricsCollector**: Real-time quality metrics collection and aggregation
- **TimeSeriesMetric**: Time-series data storage with statistical analysis
- **MetricsSnapshot**: Point-in-time quality metrics snapshots
- **Features**: Multi-threaded collection, data retention, export/import, performance tracking

#### 2. Analytics Engine (`analytics.py`) 
- **QualityAnalytics**: Comprehensive trend analysis and insights generation
- **TrendAnalysis**: Statistical trend detection with linear regression and R-squared analysis
- **QualityInsight**: Actionable insights with severity levels and recommendations
- **Features**: Anomaly detection, pattern analysis, quality scoring, predictive insights

#### 3. Alerting System (`alerts.py`)
- **QualityAlertSystem**: Multi-channel alerting with threshold monitoring
- **AlertRule**: Configurable alert conditions with rate limiting and cooldowns
- **AlertNotification**: Alert lifecycle management with acknowledgment and resolution
- **Features**: Email, Slack, webhook, SMS notifications; escalation; suppression

#### 4. Quality Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)
- **QualityDashboard**: Web-based monitoring interface with real-time visualization
- **DashboardWidget**: Configurable widgets (gauges, charts, tables, alerts)
- **DashboardConfig**: Dashboard layout and widget management
- **Features**: REST API, real-time updates, data caching, export/import

#### 5. Configuration System
- **quality_thresholds.yaml**: Comprehensive threshold configuration
- **Features**: Environment-specific overrides, pipeline-specific settings, notification thresholds

#### 6. Test Coverage
- **test_metrics.py**: 25 comprehensive test scenarios for metrics collection
- **test_analytics.py**: 20 test scenarios for analytics and trend analysis  
- **test_alerts.py**: 25 test scenarios for alerting system
- **test_dashboard.py**: 20 test scenarios for dashboard functionality
- **Coverage**: Threading, error handling, performance, integration testing

### Integration Points
✅ **Stream A Integration**: Consumes validation session results and rule execution data
✅ **Stream B Integration**: Uses structured logging infrastructure for quality events  
✅ **Core Architecture**: Leverages execution context and state management
✅ **External Systems**: Supports Prometheus, Grafana, and monitoring integrations
