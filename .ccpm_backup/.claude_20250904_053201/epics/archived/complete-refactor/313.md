# Task 005: Execution Engine

## Description
Implement the core StateGraph runner with comprehensive variable management and progress tracking capabilities to handle pipeline execution workflows.

## Objectives
- Design and implement StateGraph execution engine for workflow orchestration
- Create robust variable management system for data flow between pipeline steps
- Build comprehensive progress tracking with real-time status updates
- Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms for failed pipeline steps
- Create execution context management for isolated pipeline runs
- Design checkpoint and resume functionality for long-running pipelines

## Dependencies
- [001] Core Architecture (needs foundational structure and interfaces)
- [002] YAML Specification (needs pipeline definition format)

## Parallelization
- **Parallel**: true - Can work with other infrastructure components
- Interfaces with core architecture and YAML spec but doesn't block other development
- Can be developed alongside tool management and quality control systems

## Size & Estimation
- **Size**: L (Large complexity)
- **Estimated Duration**: 5-7 days
- Most complex component involving workflow execution, state management, and orchestration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] StateGraph runner successfully executes pipeline workflows
- [ ] Variable management handles data flow between pipeline steps
- [ ] Progress tracking provides real-time status updates
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages and recovers from failures
- [ ] Execution context isolates pipeline runs appropriately
- [ ] Checkpoint/resume functionality works for long-running pipelines

## Implementation Notes
- Design for scalability and performance optimization
- Implement robust state management with persistence
- Consider parallel execution capabilities for independent steps
- Plan for distributed execution in future iterations
- Focus on comprehensive logging and debugging support
- Design with monitoring and observability in mind
