# Personality!

**GitHub Issue:** [#213](https://github.com/ContextLab/orchestrator/issues/213)
**Status:** OPEN
**Labels:** enhancement, architecture

## Description

Add an optional "personality" field to any step that involves an LLM. The field should behaves as follows, if it exists:

1. Use an appropriate LLM (model 1) to flesh out the personality description into a full-fledged highly detailed system prompt for guiding model 2's personality, style, and behavior.
2. When prompting LLMs for the given step, update the system prompt (for model 2, which actually executes the step) according to the given fleshed-out personality prompt.

The idea is to enable rapid crafting and specification of "agents" whose behaviors change according to the specified personality.

Examples:
 - Wide-eyed naive child (good for brainstorming!)
 - Restaurant critic (highly critical, detail oriented)
 - Laboratory scientist (analytical, critical, creative, accurate)
