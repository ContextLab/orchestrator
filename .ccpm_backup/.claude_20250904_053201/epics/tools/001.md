# refactor the name of this toolbox

**GitHub Issue:** [#218](https://github.com/ContextLab/orchestrator/issues/218)
**Status:** OPEN

## Description

google recently released a similar package with the [same name](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/choosing-right-orchestrator-google-cloud), so we should think of a new one for this project.

ideas:
 - something related to orchards (something else that starts with with "orc" -- but "orc" is already taken in pypi)
 - something related to trains, conducting, driving, or masterminding a complex plan, or possibly weaving (orb-weaver? a type of spider?)
 - something totally unrelated but that seems like a neat sounding word

once we come up with a name, we need to refactor *all* files in the entire repository, and change the repository name, and also change our readthedocs hosting page.
