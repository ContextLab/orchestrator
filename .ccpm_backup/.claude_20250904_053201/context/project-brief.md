# Project Brief

## What is Orchestrator?
Orchestrator is a powerful, flexible AI pipeline orchestration framework that enables developers and data scientists to create complex AI workflows using simple YAML configuration files. It abstracts away the complexity of integrating multiple AI models and tools while providing production-ready infrastructure for reliable execution.

## Why Does It Exist?

### Problem Statement
Building AI applications typically requires:
- Complex integration code for multiple AI providers
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- State management and recovery mechanisms
- Resource optimization and cost control
- Security considerations for code execution

These challenges create significant barriers to AI adoption and slow down development cycles.

### Solution
Orchestrator solves these problems by providing:
- **Declarative Configuration**: Define workflows in YAML, not code
- **Universal Model Support**: Single interface for all AI providers
- **Intelligent Automation**: Automatic model selection and error recovery
- **Production Infrastructure**: Built-in checkpointing, monitoring, and security
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add custom tools and models

## Core Purpose

### Mission
To democratize AI application development by providing a simple, powerful, and reliable framework for orchestrating complex AI workflows.

### Vision
To become the standard platform for building, deploying, and managing AI pipelines across organizations of all sizes.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Pipeline Definition**: YAML-based workflow configuration
- **Model Integration**: Support for major AI providers
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Comprehensive set of built-in tools
- **Execution Engine**: Robust pipeline execution with recovery
- **Developer Tools**: CLI, documentation, examples
- **Security Features**: Sandboxing and input validation

### Out of Scope
- Model training or fine-tuning
- Model hosting infrastructure
- Real-time streaming pipelines
- Mobile or embedded deployments
- Custom UI/dashboard (currently)

## Key Objectives

### Technical Objectives
1. **Simplicity**: Make AI pipeline creation accessible to all developers
2. **Reliability**: Ensure robust execution with automatic recovery
3. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and resource efficiency
4. **Security**: Provide safe execution environments
5. **Extensibility**: Enable custom extensions and integrations

### Business Objectives
1. **Adoption**: Grow user base and community
2. **Quality**: Maintain high code and documentation standards
3. **Innovation**: Continuously add valuable features
4. **Sustainability**: Build a maintainable, scalable project
5. **Impact**: Enable meaningful AI applications

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
