# Comprehensive GitHub Issues Analysis for Pipeline Validation PRD

## Executive Summary

After analyzing all requested GitHub issues (#223, #211, #186, #172-182, #183, #184, #214, #2), I've identified a comprehensive scope for pipeline validation work that encompasses template resolution, runtime dependency management, advanced control flow features, individual pipeline fixes, and quality control infrastructure.

## Issue-by-Issue Analysis

### Issue #223: Template Resolution System Comprehensive Fixes
**Status**: HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKS CORE FUNCTIONALITY

**Summary**: Multiple related template resolution issues prevent templates from working across loops, filesystem operations, and structured data handling.

**Key Technical Details**:
- Loop variables ($iteration) not available in templates
- Filesystem tool not resolving template variables before execution
- Generate-structured returns strings instead of structured data
- Template resolution not consistently applied across loop contexts, tool parameters, and action outputs

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Unified template resolution layer collecting all context variables
- Resolve templates BEFORE passing to tools
- Proper exposure of structured data to template engine
- Consistent behavior across all components

**Current Status**: Needs comprehensive template system overhaul
