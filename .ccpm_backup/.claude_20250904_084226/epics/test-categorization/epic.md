# Epic: Test Categorization and Systematic Fixing

## Overview
Systematically categorize all failing tests by their dependencies and root causes, then fix them in logical groups to achieve 100% test pass rate.

## Approach
1. **Analyze all test files** to identify failure patterns
2. **Group tests by shared dependencies** (infrastructure, API, business logic)
3. **Create sub-tasks for each group** with specific fix strategies
4. **Process groups systematically** to maximize efficiency

## Current Status
- **Infrastructure fixes**: ✅ Model selection pattern fixed (11/21 tests now pass in test_data_processing.py)
- **Test framework**: ✅ TestModel/TestProvider infrastructure created
- **Next phase**: Categorize all remaining test failures by dependency groups

## Sub-Tasks
- [ ] **Phase 1: Infrastructure Fixes** - Apply TestModel pattern, fix model registry issues (60-80 tests)
- [ ] **Phase 2: API Compatibility** - Update method signatures and interfaces (40-60 tests)  
- [ ] **Phase 3: Data Structure Fixes** - Fix result access patterns and templates (30-50 tests)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Business Logic Updates** - Align validation rules and behaviors (20-40 tests)
- [ ] **Phase 5: Dependency Resolution** - Fix package conflicts and imports (15-30 tests)
- [ ] **Phase 6: Cleanup Obsolete Tests** - Remove deprecated functionality tests (10-20 tests)

## Phase Status
- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETED - TestModel pattern applied to 115/231 test files, infrastructure fixed
- **Phase 2**: ⏳ READY - API patterns identified, awaiting execution
- **Phase 3**: ✅ COMPLETED - Data structure patterns applied to all 231 test files  
- **Phase 4**: ⏳ READY - Business logic patterns ready for systematic fixing
- **Phase 5**: ⏳ PENDING - Environment specific issues to address
- **Phase 6**: ⏳ PENDING - Cleanup phase for obsolete tests

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All test files analyzed and categorized
- [ ] Test groups defined by shared dependencies
- [ ] Sub-tasks created for each logical group
