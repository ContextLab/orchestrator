# Task: Real Execution Engine Implementation

## Description
ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Replace the orchestrator's simulation-based execution with real tool and model execution. This is the most critical missing functionality - the orchestrator currently only simulates execution instead of actually running tools and models. This task transforms the orchestrator from a sophisticated demo into a fully functional AI pipeline platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace all placeholder execution logic in StateGraph with real tool/model calls
- [ ] Connect tool registry to actual tool execution with proper parameter passing
- [ ] Integrate model providers for real API calls instead of mock responses
- [ ] Implement proper variable state management storing actual execution results
- [ ] Add product file generation from real step outputs
- [ ] Progress tracking reflects actual execution progress, not simulation
- [ ] All existing pipeline definitions execute with real results instead of placeholder outputs

## Technical Details
- **Primary Focus**: src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py - Replace simulated execution logic
- **Tool Integration**: Connect tool registry to actual tool execution interfaces
- **Model Integration**: Replace mock model responses with real API calls to providers
- **State Management**: Ensure variable state stores real execution outputs
- **File Generation**: Create actual output files from step results
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain all existing pipeline definition formats

## Dependencies
- Tool registry must support real execution interface
- Model providers must have real API access configured
- Variable management system ready for actual data storage
- StateGraph engine accessible for core execution modifications

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 32
- Parallel: false (blocks other tasks - must complete first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented - real execution replaces all simulation
- [ ] Tests written and passing with real tool/model execution
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect real execution capabilities
- [ ] Code reviewed for production readiness
- [ ] All existing pipeline examples produce real results instead of simulated outputs
