# Task: Model Selection Intelligence

## Description
Implement intelligent model selection strategies and integration polish to complete the orchestrator API. This includes selection_schema support for cost/performance/balanced strategies, experts field for tool-specific model assignments, and comprehensive integration testing to ensure 100% compliance with issue #307 requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement selection_schema supporting cost/performance/balanced strategies
- [ ] Implement experts field enabling tool-specific model assignments
- [ ] Create runtime model selection algorithm choosing optimal models based on strategy
- [ ] Extend model registry with cost and performance metadata for intelligent selection
- [ ] Integration and production readiness validation across all new features
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with real API calls for all model selection scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization and error handling for production deployment

## Technical Details
- **Model Registry Enhancement**: Extend src/orchestrator/models/registry.py with cost/performance metadata
- **Selection Algorithms**: Implement cost/performance/balanced selection strategies
- **Expert Assignment**: Create tool-specific model assignment system
- **Runtime Optimization**: Dynamic model selection based on execution context and strategy
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive validation across all epic components
- **Production Polish**: Performance optimization, error handling, and monitoring

## Dependencies
- Real execution engine (Task 001) for actual model execution and performance data
- Pipeline Intelligence & Result API (Task 002) for quality control integration
- Control Flow Routing System (Task 003) for conditional model selection
- Personality & Variable Systems (Task 004) for personalized model behavior
- Model provider APIs for cost and performance metadata collection

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: false (final integration task - depends on all others)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full model selection intelligence capabilities
- [ ] Tests written and passing with real model selection scenarios across all strategies
- [ ] Documentation updated with complete API reference and selection strategy examples
- [ ] Code reviewed and production-ready with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Epic integration validated - 100% compliance with issue #307 achieved
