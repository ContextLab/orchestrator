# Epic: orchestrator-api-completion

## Overview

Transform the orchestrator from sophisticated simulation to fully functional AI pipeline platform by implementing critical execution engine and completing missing API components. This epic prioritizes real tool/model execution as the foundation, then builds comprehensive API compliance to achieve 100% implementation of issue #307 requirements.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The orchestrator currently only simulates execution instead of actually running tools and models. This epic addresses this fundamental issue first, then completes the remaining 6 API components.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Real-First Execution**: Replace all placeholder execution logic with actual tool/model calls as the foundational requirement
- **API-First Design**: Focus on completing public API contracts from #307 without breaking existing functionality
- **LangChain Integration**: Leverage LangChain structured outputs and pipeline intelligence features
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing StateGraph and compiler foundation rather than rebuilding
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes preserve existing pipeline definitions and functionality

## Technical Approach

### Execution Engine (CRITICAL)
- Replace simulated execution in StateGraph with real tool/model execution
- Connect tool registry to actual tool execution with parameter passing
- Integrate model providers for real API calls instead of mock responses
- Implement proper variable state management with actual execution results
- Add product file generation from real step outputs

### Pipeline Intelligence System
- Integrate orchestrator model for LLM-generated pipeline.intention and pipeline.architecture
- Implement architecture-intention validation during compilation
- Add markdown formatting and non-conversational output requirements

### Result API Layer
- Implement comprehensive PipelineResult class with log/outputs/qc() methods
- Add execution log capture and markdown formatting capabilities
- Create cached, performant result object interfaces

### Control Flow & Advanced Features
- Extend YAML compiler for routing attributes (condition, on_false, on_failure, on_success)
- Implement personality system with file loading and system prompt integration
- Add structured variables with LangChain integration and Pydantic model generation
- Create model selection algorithms with cost/performance/balanced strategies

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 0: Real Execution Foundation (Week 1) - CRITICAL**
- Priority: HIGHEST - Core functionality requirement
- Replace all simulated execution with real tool/model execution
- Enable actual pipeline functionality vs simulation

**Phase 1: Core API Compliance (Week 2)**
- Pipeline intelligence summaries (pipeline.intention/architecture)
- Result API implementation (log, outputs, qc methods)
- Foundation for advanced features

**Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)**
- Control flow routing system
- Personality and variable management systems
- Model selection intelligence
- Integration and production readiness

## Tasks Created
- [ ] #342 - Real Execution Engine Implementation (parallel: false - CRITICAL FIRST)
- [ ] #343 - Pipeline Intelligence & Result API (parallel: false - depends on 342)
- [ ] #344 - Control Flow Routing System (parallel: true - depends on 342)
- [ ] #345 - Personality & Variable Systems (parallel: true - depends on 342)  
- [ ] #346 - Model Selection Intelligence (parallel: false - depends on all others)

Total tasks: 5
Parallel tasks: 2 (344, 345 can run simultaneously after 342)
Sequential tasks: 3 (342 â†’ 343 â†’ 346, with 344,345 in parallel)
Estimated total effort: 124 hours (4-5 weeks)

## Dependencies

- **LangChain**: Structured output functionality for variable schemas and pipeline intelligence
- **Orchestrator Foundation**: Existing StateGraph engine, YAML compiler, and model management
- **Tool Registry**: Must support real tool execution interface for actual functionality
- **Model Providers**: Real API access for actual model execution vs simulation
- **File System**: Personality file loading from `~/.orchestrator/personalities/`

## Success Criteria (Technical)

- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Orchestrator executes real tools/models instead of simulation
- **API Coverage**: 100% implementation of #307 specification (7 missing components)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% for all new functionality with real API calls
- **Performance**: Real execution performance baseline established
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing pipeline definitions

## Estimated Effort

- **Overall Timeline**: 4-5 weeks
- **Resource Requirements**: Full-time implementation focus
- **Critical Path**: Real execution engine implementation must complete first
- **Risk Factors**: LangChain integration complexity, StateGraph modification impact
