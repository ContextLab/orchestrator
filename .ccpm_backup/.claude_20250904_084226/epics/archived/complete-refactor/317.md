# Task: Testing & Validation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing with real API calls and multi-platform support. This task ensures the refactored system is thoroughly tested, reliable, and works consistently across different environments and use cases.

## Objectives
- Implement comprehensive test suite for all new architecture components
- Create integration tests with real API calls (no mocks)
- Validate multi-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Build performance benchmarking and regression testing
- Establish continuous testing pipeline for ongoing validation

## Dependencies
- 007: API Interface (needs working API to test against)

## Parallel Processing
- Can be parallelized with repository migration (008)
- Independent testing can proceed alongside integration work
- Enables rapid feedback during migration process

## Estimated Size
Medium (3-4 days)

## Key Components
1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline execution with real API calls
3. **Platform Testing**: Multi-OS compatibility validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and regression detection
5. **Error Scenario Testing**: Validation of error handling and recovery
6. **Real-World Pipeline Testing**: Test with actual user pipeline examples

## Success Criteria
- Complete test coverage for all new architecture components
- All integration tests pass with real API calls (no mock services)
- Multi-platform compatibility confirmed across macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Performance benchmarks established and regression tests implemented
- Error handling thoroughly tested with edge cases
- Real-world pipeline examples execute successfully
- Continuous testing pipeline is functional

## Notes
This task runs in parallel with repository migration, providing continuous validation during the integration process. All tests must use real services and API calls to ensure production readiness.
