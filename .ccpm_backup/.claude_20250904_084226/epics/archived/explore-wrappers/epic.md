# Epic: explore-wrappers

## Overview

Strategic integration of three mature external tools (RouteLLM, Microsoft POML, LangChain Deep Agents) to replace custom orchestrator implementations, reduce bugs, and improve performance while maintaining 100% backward compatibility. Implementation follows a staged approach prioritizing immediate cost optimization (RouteLLM), template system enhancement (POML), and experimental evaluation (Deep Agents).

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Wrapper Pattern
- **Adapter Pattern**: Create compatibility layers maintaining existing orchestrator APIs
- **Feature Flag Strategy**: Enable/disable external tool usage without code changes
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation to existing implementations on failure
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Preserve all existing pipeline YAML syntax and tool return formats

### Technology Choices
- **RouteLLM**: Drop-in enhancement for `domain_router.py` with OpenAI-compatible interface
- **Microsoft POML**: SDK integration into existing `template_resolver.py` and `template_manager.py`
- **LangChain Deep Agents**: Prototype evaluation for `control_system.py` enhancements
- **Configuration**: Extend existing config system with feature flags and external tool settings

### Design Patterns
- **Wrapper Classes**: Thin adapters around external tools preserving orchestrator interfaces
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic selection between original and wrapped implementations based on config
- **Observer Pattern**: Monitoring and metrics collection for cost/performance tracking
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable routing and template resolution strategies

## Technical Approach

### Backend Services Enhancement
**Model Selection (RouteLLM Integration)**
- Enhance `src/orchestrator/models/domain_router.py` with intelligent routing
- Add cost tracking and performance monitoring
- Implement A/B testing infrastructure for gradual rollout
- Maintain existing `ModelSelector` interface while adding optimization

**Template Processing (POML Integration)**
- Extend `src/orchestrator/core/template_resolver.py` with POML SDK
- Enhance `src/orchestrator/core/template_manager.py` with structured markup
- Add template validation and debugging tools
- Support incremental migration from existing Jinja2 templates

**Control Flow (Deep Agents Evaluation)**
- Prototype enhancements to `src/orchestrator/core/control_system.py`
- Evaluate state management improvements for complex pipelines
- Assess parallel execution capabilities
- Document feasibility and migration complexity

### Infrastructure
**Configuration Management**
- Add feature flags for each external tool integration
- Implement environment-specific configuration for development/production
- Support credential management for external tool APIs
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing config patterns

**Monitoring & Observability**
- Cost tracking dashboards for RouteLLM routing decisions
- Template validation metrics for POML usage
- Performance benchmarking across all integrations
- Error tracking and alerting for wrapper layer failures

**Testing Framework**
- Comprehensive test suite for all wrapper implementations
- Validation testing with all 25 example pipelines
- Performance regression testing
- A/B testing infrastructure for gradual rollouts

## Implementation Strategy

- **Learning Curve**: Phased rollout with team training and documentation

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: Wrapper layer functionality and fallback mechanisms
- **Integration Testing**: Full pipeline execution with external tool integrations
- **Performance Testing**: Cost optimization and speed improvements validation
- **Quality Testing**: Manual output inspection for all 25 example pipelines
