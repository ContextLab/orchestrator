# PRD: orchestrator-completion

## Executive Summary

The orchestrator-completion initiative addresses critical functional gaps identified in the complete-refactor epic review. While the refactor successfully delivered a modern architectural foundation with excellent API design and infrastructure, three core areas remain incomplete: YAML pipeline specification compliance, real step execution functionality, and LLM-generated intelligence features. This PRD defines the requirements to transform the orchestrator from a sophisticated architectural framework into a fully operational AI pipeline orchestration platform.

**Value Proposition**: Enable users to create, compile, and execute real AI pipelines that deliver actual results rather than simulated outputs.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

The complete-refactor epic (#308) delivered excellent architectural foundations but stopped short of implementing core functional requirements from the original specification (#307). The current state leaves users with:

1. **Incomplete YAML Support**: Missing critical specification elements like expert model assignments, selection strategies, personality systems, and advanced control flow
2. **Non-Functional Execution**: Step execution uses placeholder logic instead of actually running tools and models
3. **Missing Intelligence**: No LLM-generated pipeline summaries or architecture validation as specified

### Why is this important now?

- **User Experience**: Users expect functional pipelines, not architectural demonstrations
- **Technical Debt**: Placeholder implementations create maintenance burden and confusion
- **Specification Compliance**: Original requirements (#307) remain unfulfilled despite epic completion
- **Market Readiness**: Platform cannot deliver real value without functional execution

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Data Scientist (Primary)**
- Needs to orchestrate complex AI workflows with multiple models
- Requires reliable, repeatable pipeline execution
- Values intelligent insights about pipeline behavior

**AI Engineer (Primary)** 
- Creates production-ready AI pipeline systems
- Needs full YAML specification compliance for advanced use cases
- Requires robust execution with proper error handling

**DevOps Engineer (Secondary)**
- Integrates orchestrator into CI/CD pipelines
- Needs reliable execution and comprehensive logging
- Values consistent behavior across environments

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Advanced Pipeline Creation**
```
As a Data Scientist,
I want to define expert model assignments in my YAML pipeline,
So that specific tools use optimal models for their tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Can specify expert model mappings in pipeline header
- Models are automatically selected based on tool requirements
- Selection strategy (cost/performance/balanced) is honored
- Clear error messages when no suitable models exist
```

**Journey 2: Real Pipeline Execution**
```
As an AI Engineer,
I want my pipeline steps to actually execute tools and models,
So that I get real results instead of placeholder outputs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Steps execute actual registered tools with real parameters
- Model API calls are made with proper orchestration
- Variables store real structured outputs from execution
- Product files are generated with actual content
```

**Journey 3: Pipeline Intelligence**
```
As a Data Scientist,
I want LLM-generated summaries of my pipeline's intention and architecture,
So that I can quickly understand and validate complex workflows.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Pipeline compilation generates intention summary (3-10 sentences)
- Architecture description includes control flow analysis
- Architecture-intention alignment is validated automatically
- Summaries are accessible via pipeline.intention and pipeline.architecture
```

### Pain Points Being Addressed

- **Development Friction**: Cannot test real pipeline behavior during development
- **Specification Gaps**: Advanced YAML features unavailable despite documentation
- **Production Readiness**: Placeholder execution prevents real-world deployment
- **User Confusion**: Simulated outputs mislead about actual capabilities
- **Technical Debt**: Placeholder logic requires eventual replacement anyway
