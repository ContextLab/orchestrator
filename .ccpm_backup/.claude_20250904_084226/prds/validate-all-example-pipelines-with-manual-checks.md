# PRD: Comprehensive Example Pipeline Validation & Enhancement

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a comprehensive initiative to validate, fix, and enhance all 37 example pipelines in the orchestrator toolbox. The work addresses critical template resolution issues (GitHub #223), completes individual pipeline validation (GitHub #172-182, #186), implements automated LLM-powered quality review, creates comprehensive tutorial documentation, and performs repository cleanup. This is production-quality validation work that ensures examples effectively showcase the toolbox and guide both users and development.

## Problem Statement

### Critical Issues to Address

#### 1. **Template Resolution System Failures** (GitHub #223 - CRITICAL)
- Template variables unavailable in loop contexts
- Filesystem operations failing to resolve templates  
- Structured data not properly exposed to templates
- **Impact**: Most pipeline failures stem from template resolution issues

#### 2. **Individual Pipeline Quality Issues** (GitHub #172-182, #186)
- 11 example pipelines have specific validation failures
- Outputs contain unrendered templates, debug artifacts, poor quality content
- Missing proper error handling and edge case management
- **Impact**: Examples fail to demonstrate toolbox capabilities effectively

#### 3. **Repository Organization Problems** (GitHub #2)
- Temporary files scattered throughout repository
- Inconsistent data file locations across examples
- Debug scripts and backup files in wrong locations
- **Impact**: Unprofessional repository structure, confusing for users

#### 4. **Missing Tutorial Documentation** (GitHub #214)
- Examples lack comprehensive tutorials explaining syntax and rationale
- Users cannot effectively learn from examples or remix them
- No systematic documentation of all major toolbox functionality
- **Impact**: Poor user onboarding and feature discovery

#### 5. **Lack of Quality Assurance Infrastructure**
- No automated validation of pipeline outputs for quality
- No systematic LLM review of generated content
- No regression testing framework for examples
- **Impact**: Quality degradation over time, poor user experience

## Technical Implementation

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Pipeline Test Framework
```python
class PipelineValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm_client = self._initialize_llm_client()  # Uses existing credential system
        
    def validate_pipeline(self, pipeline_name: str) -> ValidationResult:
        """Comprehensive pipeline validation"""
        # 1. Execute pipeline
        execution_result = self._execute_pipeline(pipeline_name)
        
        # 2. Validate outputs
        output_validation = self._validate_outputs(pipeline_name)
        
        # 3. LLM quality review
        quality_review = self._llm_quality_review(pipeline_name)
        
        return ValidationResult(execution_result, output_validation, quality_review)
        
    def _llm_quality_review(self, pipeline_name: str) -> QualityReview:
        """LLM-powered quality assessment with vision support"""
        outputs_path = f"examples/outputs/{pipeline_name}/"
        
        # Comprehensive quality prompt
        review_prompt = self._build_quality_prompt(outputs_path)
        
        # Use Claude Sonnet 4 or ChatGPT-5 with vision
        return self.llm_client.review_quality(review_prompt, outputs_path)
```

#### Quality Review Prompt Template
```
You are reviewing the outputs of the {pipeline_name} pipeline for production quality.

Review ALL files in examples/outputs/{pipeline_name}/ and assess:

CRITICAL ISSUES (must be fixed):
- Unrendered templates: {{variable_name}} or similar artifacts
- Debug/conversational text: "Certainly!", "Here's the...", etc.
- Incomplete content: Cut-off text, partial responses
- Incorrect locations: Files not in examples/outputs/{pipeline_name}/
- Generic naming: Files named "output.csv" instead of specific names
- Poor quality content: Inaccurate, hallucinated, or incomplete information

PRODUCTION QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
- Professional formatting and presentation
- Accurate and complete content
- Appropriate for showcasing platform capabilities  
- Clear demonstration of intended functionality
- Proper error handling where applicable

For visual outputs (images, charts), verify:
- Images render correctly without corruption
- Charts are readable with proper labels
- Visual quality is professional-grade
- Content matches expected visualization type

Provide specific feedback on each file with severity ratings (Critical/Major/Minor).
```
