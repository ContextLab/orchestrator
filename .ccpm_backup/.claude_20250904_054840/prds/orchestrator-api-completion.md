# PRD: Orchestrator API Completion

## Executive Summary

Following the comprehensive review of orchestrator-completion epic (#323) against the original requirements in issue #307, we have discovered **critical missing functionality** that prevents the orchestrator from actually working as intended. Most critically, the current implementation contains placeholder execution logic instead of real tool/model execution, plus 6 additional API features required to achieve 100% compliance with issue #307.

**Current Status**: 50% implementation completeness (lower than previously assessed)  
**Target**: 100% compliance with issue #307  
**Business Impact**: Transform orchestrator from sophisticated simulation into fully functional AI pipeline platform

## Problem Statement

During the comprehensive review of orchestrator-completion epic (#323) against the original requirements in issue #307, we identified **7 critical gaps** including a fundamental execution issue:

### Missing Components

1. **🚨 CRITICAL: Real Execution Engine** - Current implementation only simulates execution instead of actually running tools/models (Issue #322)
2. **Pipeline Intelligence Summaries** - Missing LLM-generated `pipeline.intention` and `pipeline.architecture` properties (Issue #321)
3. **Result API Methods** - Core result object functionality missing (Issue #332)
4. **Control Flow Routing** - Advanced pipeline control flow not implemented (Issue #333)  
5. **Personality System** - Custom system prompts not supported (Issue #334)
6. **Structured Variables** - LangChain structured outputs missing (Issue #335)
7. **Model Selection Schema** - Intelligent model selection strategies absent (Issue #336)

### Business Impact

Without these features, the orchestrator:
- **🚨 DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK** - Only simulates execution, doesn't execute real tools or models
- Cannot provide LLM-generated pipeline analysis and summaries
- Cannot provide comprehensive execution results and logs
- Lacks advanced pipeline control flow capabilities  
- Missing user experience enhancements for model customization
- Unable to enforce structured data outputs
- Lacks intelligent model optimization strategies

## User Stories and Requirements

### Epic US-0: Real Execution Engine (CRITICAL)
**As a** pipeline user  
**I want** the orchestrator to actually execute tools and models instead of just simulating  
**So that** I can get real results from my pipeline workflows instead of placeholder outputs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Replace all placeholder execution logic with real tool/model execution
- Tool registry executes actual tools with proper parameter passing
- Model providers make real API calls instead of mock responses
- Variable state management stores actual execution results
- Product file generation creates real output files
- Progress tracking reflects actual execution progress, not simulation

### Epic US-1: Pipeline Intelligence Summaries
**As a** pipeline developer  
**I want** LLM-generated pipeline intention and architecture summaries  
**So that** I can understand and validate pipeline design and behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `pipeline.intention` provides 3-10 sentence summary of pipeline goals
- `pipeline.architecture` provides detailed technical description of pipeline logic
- Orchestrator model validates architecture matches intention during compilation
- Summaries formatted as markdown and non-conversational
- ValidationError raised when architecture-intention mismatch detected

### Epic US-2: Result API Implementation
**As a** pipeline developer  
**I want** comprehensive execution results with logs, outputs, and quality control  
**So that** I can monitor, debug, and assess pipeline execution quality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `result.log` provides complete JSON execution log
- `result.outputs` gives dictionary access to step outputs and files
- `result.qc()` provides orchestrator model quality control analysis
- `orc.log.markdown()` formats logs for human consumption
- All methods cached and performant

### Epic US-3: Control Flow Routing
**As a** pipeline architect  
**I want** conditional execution and routing control in YAML pipelines  
**So that** I can create sophisticated workflows with error handling and branching logic

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `condition` field supports Python expressions with pipeline variables
- `on_false`, `on_failure`, `on_success` routing attributes work correctly
- StateGraph properly routes execution based on step results
- Compilation validates routing targets and prevents circular dependencies

### Epic US-4: Personality System  
**As a** AI application developer  
**I want** to customize model behavior with personality files and inline prompts  
**So that** I can optimize model outputs for specific use cases and domains

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Personality files load from `~/.orchestrator/personalities/` directory
- Inline personality strings supported in YAML
- System prompts properly applied to step models
- Compilation validates personality references

### Epic US-5: Structured Variables
**As a** data engineer  
**I want** structured output variables with type validation  
**So that** I can ensure data quality and enable reliable inter-step data flow

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- `vars` field in YAML generates Pydantic models
- LangChain structured outputs enforce variable schemas
- Template resolution works with structured data
- Type validation and error handling implemented

### Epic US-6: Model Selection Schema
**As a** cost-conscious developer  
**I want** intelligent model selection strategies  
**So that** I can optimize for cost, performance, or balanced execution

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `selection_schema` supports cost/performance/balanced strategies
- `experts` field enables tool-specific model assignments  
- Runtime model selection algorithm chooses optimal models
- Model registry includes cost and performance metadata

## Technical Architecture

### Core Design Principles

- **API First**: Focus on completing public API contracts from #307
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must preserve existing functionality
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing orchestrator-completion foundation
- **Production Quality**: Full test coverage with real API calls
