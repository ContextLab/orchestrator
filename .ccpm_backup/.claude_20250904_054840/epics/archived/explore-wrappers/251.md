# Task 005: Configuration & Monitoring

## Objective
Extend the existing configuration system to support external tool management and implement comprehensive performance tracking with monitoring dashboards for cost optimization and reliability metrics.

## Scope
Enhance configuration management for external tools and create monitoring infrastructure for performance tracking, cost analysis, and reliability metrics across all wrapper integrations.

## Key Requirements

### Primary Goals
- Extend existing config system with external tool configuration support
- Implement comprehensive cost tracking and optimization monitoring
- Create performance monitoring dashboards for wrapper layer health
- Add alerting and notification systems for external tool failures
- Establish baseline metrics for performance regression detection

### Technical Specifications

- **Cost Tracking**: Granular cost monitoring per external tool and model
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, success rate, and throughput tracking
- **Monitoring Dashboards**: Real-time visibility into wrapper layer health
- **Alerting System**: Proactive notification of issues and threshold breaches

### Configuration Management Components
1. **ExternalToolConfig** - Centralized external tool configuration management
2. **CredentialManager** - Secure API key and authentication handling
3. **EnvironmentConfig** - Environment-specific configuration overrides
4. **FeatureFlagConfig** - Granular feature flag control and inheritance
5. **ValidationConfig** - Configuration validation and constraint checking

### Monitoring Infrastructure Components
1. **CostTracker** - Real-time cost monitoring and budget tracking
2. **PerformanceMonitor** - Wrapper layer performance and reliability metrics
