# Task: Pipeline Intelligence & Result API

## Description
Implement LLM-generated pipeline intelligence summaries and comprehensive result API methods required by issue #307. This includes pipeline.intention and pipeline.architecture properties generated by the orchestrator model, plus complete result.log, result.outputs, result.qc(), and orc.log.markdown() functionality for comprehensive pipeline monitoring and analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement pipeline.intention property with 3-10 sentence LLM-generated summary of pipeline goals
- [ ] Implement pipeline.architecture property with detailed technical description of pipeline logic
- [ ] Add architecture-intention validation during compilation with ValidationError on mismatch
- [ ] Implement result.log providing complete JSON execution log
- [ ] Implement result.outputs giving dictionary access to step outputs and files
- [ ] Implement result.qc() providing orchestrator model quality control analysis
- [ ] Implement orc.log.markdown() formatting logs for human consumption
- [ ] All methods cached and performant with real execution data

## Technical Details
- **Pipeline Intelligence**: Integrate orchestrator model for intention/architecture generation
- **Result API**: Extend PipelineResult class with comprehensive logging and output access
- **Quality Control**: Add orchestrator model integration for QC analysis
- **Log Formatting**: Create markdown formatting utilities for execution logs
- **Validation**: Architecture-intention mismatch detection during compilation
- **Caching**: Implement efficient caching for expensive operations

## Dependencies
- Real execution engine (Task 001) must be complete for actual execution logs
- Orchestrator model integration for LLM-generated summaries
- LangChain integration for structured pipeline analysis
- Execution log capture infrastructure from real pipeline runs

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: false (depends on Task 001)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all pipeline intelligence and result API methods
- [ ] Tests written and passing with real pipeline execution data
- [ ] Documentation updated with complete API reference and examples
- [ ] Code reviewed for production readiness
- [ ] Integration validated with existing pipeline definitions
