# Task: Personality & Variable Systems

## Description
Implement comprehensive personality and variable management systems that provide structured configuration for agent behavior and dynamic variable handling throughout pipeline execution. This includes personality file support for agent configuration and a robust variable management system integrated with LangChain for dynamic content generation and type safety.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement personality file system for agent behavior configuration
- [ ] Create personality model with validation and loading capabilities from ~/.orchestrator/personalities/
- [ ] Support for inline personality strings in YAML pipeline definitions
- [ ] Implement structured variable system with LangChain integration and type safety
- [ ] Support for vars field in YAML generating Pydantic models for structured outputs
- [ ] Variable scoping and context management throughout pipeline execution
- [ ] Personality inheritance and composition capabilities for flexible configurations
- [ ] Variable templating and interpolation system with structured data support

## Technical Details
- **Personality Management**: Create src/orchestrator/models/personality.py for personality handling
- **Variable System**: Create comprehensive variable management with LangChain structured outputs
- **File System**: Personality file format specification and validation from ~/.orchestrator/personalities/
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic model generation from YAML variable definitions
- **Integration**: LangChain structured output functionality for variable processing
- **Templating**: Variable templating with Jinja2-like syntax for dynamic content
- **Caching**: Optimization for personality and variable lookups

## Dependencies
- Real execution engine (Task 001) for actual variable state with real data
- LangChain integration for structured variable processing
- Configuration management infrastructure for personality files
- Pipeline execution context for variable scoping

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other tasks after Task 001)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full personality and variable management capabilities
- [ ] Tests written and passing with real personality configurations and variable processing
- [ ] Documentation updated with personality file format and variable system usage
- [ ] Code reviewed for production readiness
- [ ] Integration validated with existing pipeline definitions
