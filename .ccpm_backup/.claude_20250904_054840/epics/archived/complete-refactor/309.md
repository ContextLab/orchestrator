# Task: Core Architecture Foundation

## Overview
Foundation task that enables all subsequent development. This task establishes the core architectural components required for the complete orchestrator refactor, including the new pipeline compiler, LangGraph integration, and basic execution engine.

## Objectives
- Design and implement new pipeline compiler architecture
- Integrate LangGraph as the core state management system
- Build basic execution engine foundation
- Establish architectural patterns and interfaces for subsequent tasks

## Dependencies
- None (foundation task)

## Parallel Processing
- Cannot be parallelized (blocks other tasks)
- Must be completed before tasks 002 and 003 can begin

## Estimated Size
Large (5-7 days)

## Key Components
1. **Pipeline Compiler**: Core compilation logic for transforming pipeline definitions
2. **LangGraph Integration**: State management and graph execution framework
3. **Execution Engine**: Basic runtime engine for pipeline execution
4. **Architectural Interfaces**: Define contracts for model integration, YAML processing, etc.

## Success Criteria
- Core architecture components are implemented and tested
- LangGraph integration is functional
- Basic execution engine can run simple pipelines
- Interfaces are defined for YAML parsing and model integration
- All tests pass and code is well-documented

## Notes
This is a blocking task that establishes the foundation for all subsequent development work in the refactor.
