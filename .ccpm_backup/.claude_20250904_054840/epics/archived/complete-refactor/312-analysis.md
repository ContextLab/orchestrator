# Issue #312 Analysis: Tool & Resource Management

## Task Overview
Create comprehensive tool registry, automatic setup, and dependency handling systems to manage all external tools and resources required by pipeline execution.

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ [#309] Core Architecture Foundation - COMPLETED
- **Ready to proceed**: All dependencies satisfied

## Parallel Work Stream Analysis

### Stream A: Tool Registry & Discovery
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/tools/registry.py`, `src/orchestrator/tools/__init__.py`
**Scope**: 
- Tool registry system for discovering and managing available tools
- Tool versioning and compatibility checking
- Extensible registry design for easy tool addition
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 days

### Stream B: Automatic Setup & Installation
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/tools/setup.py`, `src/orchestrator/tools/installers.py`
**Scope**:
- Automatic setup mechanisms for tool installation and configuration
- Platform-aware installation strategies
- Configuration management and validation
**Dependencies**: Stream A interfaces (can start in parallel with basic structure)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

### Stream C: Dependency & Resource Management
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/tools/dependencies.py`, `src/orchestrator/tools/resources.py`
**Scope**:
- Dependency handling system to ensure all required resources are available
- Resource management for efficient tool lifecycle management
- Dependency resolution algorithms
**Dependencies**: Stream A registry interfaces (can start after basic registry structure)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

## Parallel Execution Plan

### Wave 1 (Immediate Start)
- **Stream A**: Tool Registry & Discovery
- **Stream B**: Automatic Setup & Installation (basic structure)

### Wave 2 (After Stream A basic interfaces)
- **Stream C**: Dependency & Resource Management
- **Stream B**: Complete integration with registry

## File Structure Plan
```
src/orchestrator/tools/
├── __init__.py          # Module exports
├── registry.py         # Stream A: Tool discovery and registry
├── setup.py            # Stream B: Automatic setup mechanisms
├── installers.py       # Stream B: Platform-specific installation
├── dependencies.py     # Stream C: Dependency resolution
└── resources.py        # Stream C: Resource lifecycle management
```

## Integration Points
- **Foundation Interface**: Uses `src/orchestrator/foundation/` components
- **Tool Registry**: Central registry that other streams depend on
- **Setup System**: Integrates with registry for tool installation
- **Dependency Resolution**: Uses registry for tool discovery and validation

## Success Criteria Mapping
- Stream A: Tool registry discovery, tool versioning and compatibility
- Stream B: Automatic setup and tool installation/configuration  
- Stream C: Dependency handling, resource management and lifecycle

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A must establish core registry interfaces before Stream C can integrate
- Stream B can work independently on setup mechanisms with defined interfaces
- All streams must coordinate on tool metadata and configuration formats
- Registry serves as central coordination point for tool information
- Integration testing required as streams converge on shared tool management

## Security Considerations
- Tool installation requires careful sandboxing and permission management
- Dependency resolution must validate tool authenticity and integrity
- Resource management needs cleanup and isolation capabilities
- Registry must protect against malicious tool registration
