# Stream D: Comprehensive Testing

## Scope
End-to-end pipeline validation with real StateGraph scenarios

## Files
- `tests/yaml/test_stategraph_compilation.py`
- `tests/yaml/test_enhanced_validation.py`
- `tests/integration/test_yaml_workflow.py`

## Dependencies
- Stream A (foundation interfaces) - ✅ COMPLETED
- Stream B (YAML integration) - ✅ COMPLETED

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Comprehensive Test Framework: Complete testing suite for YAML → StateGraph
- Real-World Validation: Tested with authentic StateGraph execution (no mocks)
- Stream Integration: Validated all previous streams work together seamlessly
- Production Readiness: Complete YAML pipeline specification system validated

## Success Criteria Achieved
✅ YAML pipelines can be parsed and validated
✅ Valid pipelines compile to executable StateGraphs  
✅ Comprehensive error handling for invalid specifications
✅ Schema documentation accuracy confirmed
✅ All parsing and validation functionality working
