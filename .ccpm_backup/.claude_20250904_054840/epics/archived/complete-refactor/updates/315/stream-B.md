# Stream B: Pipeline Operations

## Scope
- Pipeline compilation methods with YAML specification integration
- Pipeline execution methods with status tracking and monitoring
- Integration with execution engine and progress tracking

## Files
- `src/orchestrator/api/pipeline.py`
- `src/orchestrator/api/execution.py`

## Progress
- ✅ Created specialized pipeline.py module with advanced compilation features
- ✅ Implemented AdvancedPipelineCompiler with comprehensive YAML integration
- ✅ Added pipeline compilation methods with enhanced validation and error handling
- ✅ Implemented dependency analysis and template context requirements
- ✅ Created execution.py module with comprehensive pipeline execution methods
- ✅ Implemented PipelineExecutor with advanced monitoring and control
- ✅ Added pipeline execution methods with status tracking and monitoring
- ✅ Integrated with execution engine and progress tracking systems
- ✅ Created specialized pipeline execution control methods (pause, resume, stop)
- ✅ Added real-time monitoring with streaming progress updates
- ✅ Updated API __init__.py to export new specialized modules
- ✅ Committed changes: df1a471

## Key Features Implemented

### AdvancedPipelineCompiler
- Enhanced YAML compilation with preprocessing support
- Comprehensive validation reporting
- Dependency analysis without full compilation
- Template context requirements extraction
- Compilation result caching for performance
- Advanced error handling with structured exceptions

### PipelineExecutor
- Advanced execution with concurrent execution management
- Real-time progress tracking and monitoring
- Streaming execution updates with AsyncIterator interface
- Execution control operations (pause, resume, stop)
- Comprehensive execution metrics and performance monitoring
- Resource cleanup and graceful shutdown

## Integration Achieved
- Full integration with execution engine components
- Progress tracking with ProgressTracker and ProgressEvent
- Status monitoring with ExecutionStatus and ExecutionMetrics
- Variable management through VariableManager integration
- Recovery mechanisms through RecoveryManager integration

## Completion Status
Stream B implementation is **COMPLETE** ✅
