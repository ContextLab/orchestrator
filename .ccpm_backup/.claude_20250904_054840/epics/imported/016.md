# Repository cleanup

**GitHub Issue:** [#2](https://github.com/ContextLab/orchestrator/issues/2)
**Status:** OPEN

## Description

The repository has gotten messy:
  - Several tests are in the top-level folder, but they should be integrated into the formal pytests
  - Several notes files (also in the top-level folder); these should be added to the relevant github issues and then removed (after committing them to back them up)
  - there are two "reports" folders-- one under the top level folder, and one under examples/.  these can actually both be deleted, since we need to re-do all examples anyway.  but in the future we should maintain the test outputs in a single location.
 
We also need some updates and corrections:
  - all of the docs/tutorials/examples/ examples need to be rewritten to use the new YAML-only framework
  - we need explicit tests of each of the updated tutorials, and the old (now outdated) tests need to be removed
  - each example pipeline should be tested using real models and prompts so that we can manually inspect the outputs.  attach the results to this issue (in comments or file attachments), along with your assessment of the quality of the product and any issues or concerns you notice.
  - we need to update the documentation related to defining tools and indicating which tools should be used in YAML pipeline files
  - in general, the full API documentation needs to be reviewed in light of the new updates and changes

And finally, further testing is needed:
 - add comprehensive tests for new functionality
 - ensure that *all* of the code in the toolbox works
 - run mypy and linters to verify (or correct) code quality
