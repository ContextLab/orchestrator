# Task: Tutorial Documentation System

## Description
Implement comprehensive tutorial generation and validation system addressing Issue #214 requirements. Auto-generate pipeline tutorials using existing Sphinx documentation infrastructure, verify 100% accuracy of syntax, organize by theme, and validate all documented functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Auto-generation of comprehensive tutorials for each example pipeline
- [ ] 100% accuracy verification by executing all documented code/syntax
- [ ] Theme-based organization with clear navigation structure
- [ ] Integration with existing Sphinx documentation system
- [ ] Link validation and dependency reference checking
- [ ] Example output showcase linked to working pipeline results
- [ ] User remixing and customization guidance included

## Technical Details
- **Integration**: Extend existing Sphinx documentation in `docs/tutorials/pipeline_examples/`
- **Generation**: Automated tutorial creation from pipeline analysis and templates
- **Validation**: Execute documented code to verify accuracy and functionality
- **Organization**: Theme-based categorization (data processing, creative, research, etc.)
- **Links**: Validate all documentation links and dependency references
- **Examples**: Connect tutorials to actual pipeline outputs for demonstration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Clean repository organization for consistent tutorial structure
- [ ] Task 002: Enhanced validation engine for tutorial syntax verification
- [ ] Analysis of existing Sphinx documentation structure and extension points
- [ ] Tutorial content templates and theme organization strategy

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 20-24 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run with 006, 007)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Tutorial generation system implemented and operational
- [ ] 100% of example pipelines have accurate, working tutorials
- [ ] Theme-based organization with navigation integrated
- [ ] All tutorial syntax verified through automated execution
- [ ] Link validation and dependency checking operational
- [ ] User remixing guidance included in all tutorials
