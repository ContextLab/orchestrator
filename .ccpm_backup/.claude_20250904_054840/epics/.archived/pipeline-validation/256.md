# Task: Enhanced Validation Engine

## Description
Extend existing pipeline validation scripts with comprehensive quality assessment framework. Build on current `PipelineValidator` class to add template rendering validation, quality scoring, and integration framework for LLM review and other quality assessment plugins.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extended `PipelineValidator` class with quality assessment framework
- [ ] Template rendering validator detecting unrendered {{variables}}
- [ ] Quality scoring system (0-100 scale) with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Plugin architecture for modular quality assessment components
- [ ] Integration with existing parallel execution and timeout handling
- [ ] Support for pipeline-specific validation rules and strategies
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and error handling for quality issues

## Technical Details
- **Core File**: `scripts/enhanced_pipeline_validator.py` extending existing validation
- **Framework**: `src/orchestrator/validation/` for quality assessment components
- **Integration**: Plugin system for LLM review, visual validation, template checks
- **Patterns**: Chain of responsibility for validation stages, strategy pattern for pipeline types
- **Existing Code**: Build on `scripts/validate_all_pipelines.py` PipelineValidator class

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Repository organization provides clean foundation
- [ ] Analysis of existing validation scripts and extension points
- [ ] Quality scoring algorithm design and calibration
- [ ] Plugin interface definition for quality assessment components

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 24-30 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run with 003, 004 after 001)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Enhanced validation engine implemented and tested
- [ ] Quality assessment framework operational
- [ ] Template rendering validation working across all pipelines
- [ ] Plugin architecture supports LLM and visual validation integration
- [ ] All existing validation functionality preserved
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for new quality assessment features
