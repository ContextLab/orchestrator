## Cleanup Results

### Files and Directories Removed:
- **34 __pycache__ directories** - Removed all compiled Python bytecode cache directories

- **1 temporary file** - `/Users/jmanning/orchestrator/src/orchestrator/core/error_handler.py.tmp`
- **temp/safety_backups/ directory** - Removed old backup directory (files already moved to proper locations)

### Repository Size Impact:
- Significantly reduced repository size by removing cache files and temporary data
- Eliminated unnecessary development artifacts
- Cleaned up safety backup files that had served their purpose

### .gitignore Enhancements:
- Added `debug_*` pattern to ignore debug files
