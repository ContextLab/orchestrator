## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
```
orchestrator.testing/
├── __init__.py                 # Module exports
├── pipeline_discovery.py      # Pipeline discovery and categorization
├── pipeline_test_suite.py     # Core testing framework  
├── test_input_manager.py      # Input data management
├── pipeline_validator.py      # YAML and best practices validation
└── test_reporter.py           # Multi-format reporting
```

### Integration Points
- **Model Registry:** Seamless integration with `init_models()`
- **Orchestrator:** Direct usage of existing orchestrator instances
- **Pytest:** Standard pytest fixtures and test classes
- **CLI:** Standalone script for automation and development

### Quality Assurance

- **Validation:** Multi-layer validation (execution, templates, organization)

## Validation Results

### Infrastructure Testing
```bash
pytest tests/test_pipeline_infrastructure.py -v
# Result: All core infrastructure tests PASS
```

### Discovery Testing  
```bash  
python scripts/run_pipeline_tests.py --discover-only
# Result: 36 pipelines discovered and categorized successfully
```
