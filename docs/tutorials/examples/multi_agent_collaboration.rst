Multi-Agent Collaboration
=========================

This example demonstrates how to build a sophisticated multi-agent system using the Orchestrator's declarative YAML framework. Multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems through coordination, communication, and emergent problem-solving - all defined in pure YAML with no custom Python code required.

.. note::
   **Level:** Advanced  
   **Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
   **Prerequisites:** Orchestrator framework installed, multiple API keys configured

Overview
--------

The Multi-Agent Collaboration system orchestrates:

1. **Agent Network Creation**: Initialize specialized agents with different roles
2. **Problem Decomposition**: Break complex problems into manageable sub-tasks
3. **Task Assignment**: Match agent capabilities to sub-problems
4. **Collaborative Solving**: Agents work together through multiple rounds
5. **Consensus Building**: Reach agreement through negotiation
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle disagreements constructively
7. **Solution Integration**: Combine partial solutions into unified whole
8. **Emergent Analysis**: Study patterns that emerge from collaboration

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Declarative YAML pipeline definition
- AUTO tag resolution for natural language task descriptions
- Dynamic agent creation and role assignment
- Multi-round collaboration with convergence checking
- Peer review and conflict resolution
- Emergent behavior analysis
- No Python code required

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

   # Set up environment variables
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
   
   # Run the multi-agent system
   orchestrator run examples/multi_agent_collaboration.yaml \
     --input problem="Design a sustainable city for 1 million people" \
     --input num_agents=7 \
     --input max_rounds=15

Complete YAML Pipeline
----------------------

The complete pipeline is defined in ``examples/multi_agent_collaboration.yaml``. Here are the key sections:

**Pipeline Structure:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Multi-Agent Collaboration"
   description: "Collaborative multi-agent system for complex problem solving"

   inputs:
     problem:
       type: string
       description: "Complex problem to solve collaboratively"
       required: true
     
     num_agents:
       type: integer
       description: "Number of agents to create"
       default: 5
     
     max_rounds:
       type: integer
       description: "Maximum collaboration rounds"
       default: 10
     
     consensus_threshold:
       type: float
       description: "Threshold for solution consensus (0-1)"
       default: 0.85

**Key Pipeline Steps:**

1. **Agent Network Initialization:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   - id: initialize_agents
     action: <AUTO>create a network of {{num_agents}} specialized AI agents with roles:
       1. Researcher agents - gather information and conduct analysis
       2. Analyst agents - process data and identify patterns
       3. Creative agents - generate innovative solutions
       4. Critic agents - evaluate and identify issues
       5. Synthesizer agent - integrate and coordinate
       
       Create communication channels between agents.
       Return agent profiles and network topology</AUTO>

2. **Collaborative Problem Solving:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   - id: collaboration_round
     action: <AUTO>agents work on assigned tasks collaboratively:
       1. Each agent analyzes their assigned sub-problem
       2. Agents share insights through message passing
       3. Request help from peers when needed
       4. Build on each other's solutions
       5. Update shared knowledge base</AUTO>
     loop:
       max_iterations: "{{max_rounds}}"
       break_condition: "{{check_convergence.result.score}} >= {{consensus_threshold}}"

3. **Emergent Behavior Analysis:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   - id: analyze_emergence
     action: <AUTO>analyze emergent behaviors from agent collaboration:
       1. Communication patterns and clusters
       2. Information flow dynamics
       3. Decision-making patterns
       4. Self-organization indicators
       5. Collective intelligence metrics</AUTO>

How It Works
------------

**1. Agent Specialization**

The framework automatically creates agents with different cognitive styles:

- **Researchers**: High exploration, broad information gathering
- **Analysts**: Precise, data-driven, pattern recognition
- **Creatives**: High temperature, lateral thinking
- **Critics**: Low temperature, risk assessment
- **Synthesizers**: Balanced, integration focused

**2. Communication Protocols**

Agents communicate through:
- Direct messaging for specific requests
- Broadcast messages for announcements
- Shared knowledge base for persistent information
- Voting mechanisms for decisions

**3. Convergence Dynamics**

The system monitors convergence through:
- Solution similarity metrics
- Consensus scores
- Iteration efficiency
- Quality improvements

Running the Pipeline
--------------------

**Using the CLI:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Basic multi-agent problem solving
   orchestrator run multi_agent_collaboration.yaml \
     --input problem="Develop a climate change mitigation strategy"

   # With more agents and rounds
   orchestrator run multi_agent_collaboration.yaml \
     --input problem="Design an AI governance framework" \
     --input num_agents=10 \
     --input max_rounds=20

   # Custom consensus threshold
   orchestrator run multi_agent_collaboration.yaml \
     --input problem="Create a universal healthcare system" \
     --input consensus_threshold=0.9

**Using Python SDK:**

.. code-block:: python

   from orchestrator import Orchestrator
   
   # Initialize orchestrator
   orchestrator = Orchestrator()
   
   # Run multi-agent collaboration
   result = await orchestrator.run_pipeline(
       "multi_agent_collaboration.yaml",
       inputs={
           "problem": "Design a mars colony infrastructure",
           "num_agents": 8,
           "max_rounds": 15,
           "agent_roles": "balanced"
       }
   )
   
   # Access results
   print(f"Solution quality: {result['outputs']['quality_score']}")
   print(f"Rounds needed: {result['outputs']['rounds_executed']}")
   print(f"Convergence achieved: {result['outputs']['convergence_achieved']}")
