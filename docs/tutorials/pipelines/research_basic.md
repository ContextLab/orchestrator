## Customization Guide

### Input Modifications
- Modify input parameters to match your specific data sources
- Adjust file paths and data formats as needed for your environment

### Parameter Tuning
- Adjust model parameters (temperature, max_tokens) for different output styles
- Modify prompts to change the tone and focus of generated content

### Step Modifications
- Add new steps by following the same pattern as existing ones
- Remove steps that aren't needed for your specific use case
- Reorder steps if your workflow requires different sequencing
- Replace tool actions with alternatives that provide similar functionality

### Output Customization
- Change output file paths and formats to match your requirements
- Modify output templates to customize the structure and content
- This pipeline produces Analysis results, Markdown documents, Reports - adjust output configuration accordingly

## Remixing Instructions

### Compatible Patterns
- fact_checker.yaml - for content verification
- research workflows - for information gathering

### Extension Ideas
- Add iterative processing for continuous improvement
- Implement parallel processing for better performance
- Include advanced error recovery mechanisms

### Combination Examples
- Combine with fact_checker.yaml to verify research claims
- Use with creative_image_pipeline.yaml to generate visual research summaries
- Integrate with data_processing.yaml to analyze research data

### Advanced Variations
- Scale to handle larger datasets and more complex processing
- Add real-time processing capabilities for streaming data
- Implement distributed processing across multiple systems
- Use multiple AI models for comparison and validation

## Hands-On Exercise

### Execution Instructions
- 1. Navigate to your orchestrator project directory
- 1.5. Ensure you have access to required services: Web search APIs
- 2. Run: python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/research_basic.yaml
- 3. Monitor the output for progress and any error messages
- 4. Check the output directory for generated results

### Expected Outputs
- Generated Analysis results in the specified output directory
- Generated Markdown documents in the specified output directory
- Generated Reports in the specified output directory
- Execution logs showing step-by-step progress
- Completion message with runtime statistics
- No error messages or warnings (successful execution)

### Troubleshooting
- **API Authentication Errors**: Ensure all required API keys are properly configured in your environment
- **Template Resolution Errors**: Check that all input parameters are provided and template syntax is correct
- **General Execution Errors**: Check the logs for specific error messages and verify your orchestrator installation

### Verification Steps
- Check that the pipeline completed without errors
- Verify all expected output files were created
- Review the output content for quality and accuracy
- Review generated content for relevance and quality
