# Pipeline Tutorial: simple_timeout_test

## Overview

**Complexity Level**: Beginner  
**Difficulty Score**: 0/100  
**Estimated Runtime**: < 5 minutes  

### Purpose
This pipeline demonstrates  and provides a practical example of orchestrator's capabilities for beginner-level workflows.

### Use Cases
- General automation tasks

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax

### Key Concepts
- Basic pipeline structure

## Pipeline Breakdown

### Configuration Analysis
- **input_section**: Defines the data inputs and parameters for the pipeline
- **steps_section**: Contains the sequence of operations to be executed
- **output_section**: Specifies how results are formatted and stored
- **template_usage**: Uses 0 template patterns for dynamic content
- **feature_highlights**: Demonstrates 0 key orchestrator features

### Data Flow
This pipeline processes input parameters through 0 steps to generate the specified outputs.

### Control Flow
Follows linear execution flow from first step to last step.

### Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
name: simple_timeout_test
description: Simple test for timeout functionality

steps:
  - id: test_timeout
    action: "Sleep for 5 seconds to test timeout"
    tool: python-executor
    parameters:
      code: |
        import time
        print("Starting sleep...")
        time.sleep(5)
        print("Finished sleeping")
        result = {"status": "completed"}
        print(f"Result: {result}")
    timeout: 2  # This should timeout after 2 seconds
```

## Customization Guide

### Input Modifications
- Modify input parameters to match your specific data sources
- Adjust file paths and data formats as needed for your environment

### Parameter Tuning
- Adjust step parameters to customize behavior for your needs

### Step Modifications
- Add new steps by following the same pattern as existing ones
- Remove steps that aren't needed for your specific use case
- Reorder steps if your workflow requires different sequencing
- Replace tool actions with alternatives that provide similar functionality

### Output Customization
- Change output file paths and formats to match your requirements
- Modify output templates to customize the structure and content
- This pipeline produces Text output - adjust output configuration accordingly

## Remixing Instructions

### Compatible Patterns
- Most basic pipelines can be combined with this pattern

### Extension Ideas
- Add error handling and recovery steps
- Implement conditional logic for different scenarios
- Include data validation and quality checks

### Combination Examples
- Can be combined with most other pipeline patterns

### Advanced Variations
- Scale to handle larger datasets and more complex processing
- Add real-time processing capabilities for streaming data
- Implement distributed processing across multiple systems

## Hands-On Exercise

### Execution Instructions
- 1. Navigate to your orchestrator project directory
- 2. Run: python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/simple_timeout_test.yaml
- 3. Monitor the output for progress and any error messages
- 4. Check the output directory for generated results

### Expected Outputs
- Generated Text output in the specified output directory
- Execution logs showing step-by-step progress
- Completion message with runtime statistics
- No error messages or warnings (successful execution)

### Troubleshooting
- **General Execution Errors**: Check the logs for specific error messages and verify your orchestrator installation

### Verification Steps
- Check that the pipeline completed without errors
- Verify all expected output files were created
- Review the output content for quality and accuracy
