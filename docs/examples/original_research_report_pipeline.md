## Overview

The Original Research Report Pipeline represents an advanced, experimental pipeline design that pushes the boundaries of autonomous research and report generation. It demonstrates sophisticated AUTO tag usage, complex nested control flows, parallel verification queues, and comprehensive quality assurance mechanisms for producing high-quality research reports with fact-checking and source verification.

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Dynamic Output Generation
```yaml
outputs:
  pdf: 
    value: "<AUTO>come up with an appropriate filename for the final report</AUTO>"
  tex: 
    value: "{{ outputs.pdf[:-4] }}.tex"
```

### 2. Complex Nested AUTO Tags
```yaml
action: "<AUTO>search the web for <AUTO>construct an appropriate web query about {{ topic }}, using these additional instructions: {{ instructions }}</AUTO></AUTO>"
```

### 3. Parallel Verification Queues
```yaml
create_parallel_queue:
  on: "<AUTO>create a list of every source in this document: {{ compile-search-results.result }}</AUTO>"
  task:
    action_loop:
      - action: "<AUTO>verify the authenticity of this source...</AUTO>"
      - action: "<AUTO>if {{ verify-source.result }} is 'false', update...</AUTO>"
    until: "<AUTO>all sources have been verified (or removed, if incorrect)</AUTO>"
```

### 4. File Inclusion Syntax
```yaml
action: "<AUTO>{{ file:report_draft_prompt.md }}</AUTO>"
```

### 5. Model Requirements Specification
```yaml
requires_model:
  min_size: "40B"
  expertise: "very-high"
```

## Pipeline Architecture

### Input Parameters
- **topic** (required): Research topic for the report
- **instructions** (required): Additional instructions for report generation

### Processing Flow

1. **Web Search** - Autonomous web search with query generation
2. **Compile Search Results** - Collate results into cohesive document
3. **Quality Check Compilation** - Parallel source verification
4. **Draft Report** - Generate initial report draft
5. **Quality Check Assumptions** - Parallel claim verification
6. **Quality Check Full Report** - Comprehensive final review
7. **Compile LaTeX** - Convert to LaTeX format
8. **Compile PDF** - Generate final PDF report

### Advanced Control Flow Patterns

#### Parallel Verification Queue
```yaml
create_parallel_queue:
  on: "<AUTO>dynamic list generation</AUTO>"
  tool: headless-browser
  task:
    action_loop:
      - action: "verification step"
      - action: "correction step"
    until: "completion condition"
```

#### Multi-Stage Quality Control
1. **Source Verification**: Check authenticity of all references
2. **Claim Verification**: Validate factual accuracy of statements
3. **Full Report Review**: Comprehensive quality assessment

### Model Expertise Levels
```yaml
expertise_levels:
  - "medium": Basic research and compilation tasks
  - "medium-high": Advanced analysis and synthesis
  - "high": Complex reasoning and quality assessment
  - "very-high": Comprehensive review and validation
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Research Report
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/original_research_report_pipeline.yaml \
  -i topic="climate change mitigation strategies" \
  -i instructions="Focus on technological solutions and implementation challenges"
```

### Technical Research
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/original_research_report_pipeline.yaml \
  -i topic="quantum computing applications in cryptography" \
  -i instructions="Include technical details and current research developments"
```

### Policy Analysis
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/original_research_report_pipeline.yaml \
  -i topic="artificial intelligence regulation frameworks" \
  -i instructions="Compare different national approaches and effectiveness"
```

## Experimental Features

### Dynamic Filename Generation
```yaml
pdf: "<AUTO>come up with an appropriate filename for the final report</AUTO>"
# Automatically generates contextually appropriate filenames
# Example outputs: "climate_change_mitigation_report_2024.pdf"
```

### Nested AUTO Resolution
```yaml
action: "<AUTO>search the web for <AUTO>construct web query about {{ topic }}</AUTO></AUTO>"
# Inner AUTO tag resolves first to create query
# Outer AUTO tag uses resolved query for search action
```

### Conditional Content Updates
```yaml
action: "<AUTO>if {{ verify-source.result }} is 'false', update {{ compile-search-results.result }} to remove the reference</AUTO>"
# Intelligent content modification based on verification results
```

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Three-Stage Verification
1. **Source Authentication**: Verify all web sources exist and are accurately cited
2. **Claim Validation**: Check factual accuracy of all non-trivial claims
3. **Comprehensive Review**: Final quality assessment of complete report

### Verification Methods
- **Web Link Following**: Manual verification of source accessibility
- **Cross-Reference Checking**: Validate claims against multiple sources
- **Logical Reasoning**: Deductive inference based on evidence
- **Accuracy Assessment**: Truth verification through search and analysis

### Quality Metrics
```yaml
verification_criteria:
  - "Source authenticity and accessibility"
  - "Claim accuracy and supporting evidence"
  - "Logical consistency and reasoning"
  - "Comprehensive coverage of topic"
  - "Professional presentation quality"
```

## Advanced AUTO Tag Patterns

### List Generation
```yaml
"<AUTO>create a comprehensive list of every non-trivial claim made in this document</AUTO>"
```

### Conditional Processing
```yaml
"<AUTO>if {{ condition }} is 'false', update {{ document }} to remove the reference</AUTO>"
```

### Complex Template Resolution
```yaml
"<AUTO>{{ file:report_draft_prompt.md }}</AUTO>"
# Combines file inclusion with AUTO tag processing
```

### Multi-Step Operations
```yaml
"<AUTO>verify accuracy by (a) doing web search and (b) using logical reasoning</AUTO>"
```

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
```
./searches/{{ outputs.pdf }}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compiled_results.md              # Initial compilation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compiled_results_corrected.md    # Source-verified version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ draft_report.md                  # Initial draft
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ draft_report_corrected.md        # Claim-verified version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ final_report.md                  # Quality-assured version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ final_report.tex                 # LaTeX version
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final_report.pdf                 # Final PDF output
```
