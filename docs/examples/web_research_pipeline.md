## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Stage Web Search Strategy
```yaml
- id: initial_search
  tool: web-search
  parameters:
    query: "{{ research_topic }} latest developments 2024"
    
- id: themed_searches
  tool: web-search
  foreach: "{{ identify_themes.result.trending_subtopics[:3] }}"
  parallel: true
```

### 2. Content Extraction with Headless Browser
```yaml
- id: fetch_content
  tool: headless-browser
  action: extract
  foreach: "{{ initial_search.results[:5] }}"
  parameters:
    extract_main_content: true
    include_metadata: true
    timeout: 10000
```

### 3. Parallel Processing with Error Handling
```yaml

8. **Generate Visualizations** - Create charts and infographics (comprehensive mode)
9. **Compile Final Report** - Assemble complete research report
10. **Export Report** - Generate final output in requested format

### Research Depth Levels

#### Quick Research
```yaml
research_depth: "quick"
# Basic search and analysis only
# Minimal source validation
# Fast turnaround time
```

#### Standard Research  
```yaml
research_depth: "standard"
# Includes themed searches
# Source analysis and extraction
# Balanced depth and speed
```

#### Comprehensive Research
```yaml
research_depth: "comprehensive"
# Full validation and cross-referencing
# Visual analysis and charts
# Maximum depth and accuracy
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Research Report
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/web_research_pipeline.yaml \
  -i research_topic="renewable energy storage technologies" \
  -i research_depth="standard"
```

### Comprehensive Analysis
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/web_research_pipeline.yaml \
  -i research_topic="blockchain applications in supply chain" \
  -i research_depth="comprehensive" \
  -i max_sources=15
```

### Quick Research
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/web_research_pipeline.yaml \
  -i research_topic="quantum computing breakthroughs 2024" \
  -i research_depth="quick" \
  -i output_format="markdown"
```

### Custom Output Location
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py examples/web_research_pipeline.yaml \
  -i research_topic="artificial intelligence ethics" \
  -i output_path="custom_research_reports"
```

## Advanced Search Strategy

### Initial Broad Search
```yaml
query: "{{ research_topic }} latest developments 2024"
region: "us-en"
safesearch: "moderate"
# Captures current state and recent developments
```

### Theme-Based Deep Search
```yaml
foreach: "{{ identify_themes.result.trending_subtopics[:3] }}"
query: "{{ research_topic }} {{ item }}"
parallel: true
# Explores specific aspects in parallel
```

### Search Optimization
- **Regional Targeting**: "us-en" for English-language results
- **Safety Filtering**: "moderate" safesearch for appropriate content
- **Result Limiting**: Configurable result counts for performance
- **Parallel Execution**: Simultaneous themed searches for efficiency

## Content Analysis Framework

### Theme Extraction
```yaml
analysis_outputs:
  - "main_themes": "5-7 key topics identified"
  - "key_organizations": "Organizations mentioned across sources"
  - "trending_subtopics": "Current trending aspects of topic"
```

### Source Analysis
```yaml
research_extraction:
  - "key_findings": "Main points, discoveries, conclusions"
  - "data_points": "Statistics and metrics with context"
  - "credibility_score": "0-1 reliability assessment"
  - "relevant_quotes": "2-3 most important quotations"
```

### Credibility Assessment
```yaml
credibility_factors:
  - "Source authority": "Domain reputation and expertise"
  - "Citation quality": "References and supporting evidence"  
  - "Content depth": "Thoroughness and detail level"
  - "Bias indicators": "Objectivity and balance assessment"
```

## Parallel Processing Features

### Concurrent Themed Searches
```yaml
parallel: true
foreach: "{{ identify_themes.result.trending_subtopics[:3] }}"
# Searches multiple themes simultaneously
# Reduces total processing time
# Maximizes information gathering efficiency
```

### Fault-Tolerant Content Extraction
```yaml
on_failure: continue
timeout: 10000
# Continues processing despite individual failures
# Prevents single source failures from stopping pipeline
# Maintains robustness across unreliable sources
```

### Error Recovery Patterns
- **Continue on Failure**: Skip problematic sources, continue with available data
- **Timeout Management**: Prevent hanging on slow-loading pages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Produce reports with partial data when needed
