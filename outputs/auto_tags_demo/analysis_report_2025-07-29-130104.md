**Analysis Goal:** identify trends and anomalies

## Executive Summary

{{ create_report.content }}

## Distribution Plan

I'd be happy to help you determine the stakeholder groups, priority level, and follow-up actions for your report. However, I need more information about the specific trends and anomalies you've identified in your analysis.

Could you please provide:
- What type of data or metrics you analyzed
- What specific trends you discovered
- What anomalies were detected
- The context or domain (e.g., financial, operational, security, quality control)

Once I have these details, I can provide specific recommendations for:
1. Which stakeholder groups should receive the report
2. The appropriate priority level
3. Targeted follow-up actions

For example, if you're analyzing cybersecurity incidents with increasing breach attempts, that would require different stakeholders and urgency than if you're analyzing seasonal sales trends with minor inventory anomalies.
