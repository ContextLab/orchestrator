# Update on JIT Template Rendering Implementation

## Summary
I've made significant progress on implementing Just-In-Time (JIT) template rendering for the orchestrator. The goal is to render templates only when their dependencies are satisfied, rather than at compile time.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Template Analysis (Completed)
- Created `TemplateMetadata` class to track template dependencies
- Updated `YAMLCompiler` to analyze templates and identify which step results they depend on
- Modified `Task` class to store template metadata

### 2. Control Flow Integration (Completed)
- Fixed issue where conditional tasks weren't getting their templates analyzed
- Updated `ControlFlowCompiler` to preserve template metadata for conditional tasks

### 3. Current Challenge
The main challenge is coordinating template rendering with task execution order. Specifically:

- Conditional tasks need to evaluate their conditions to determine if they should execute
- But the condition templates can't be rendered until dependencies complete
- This creates a chicken-and-egg problem

### Example from research_advanced_tools.yaml:
```yaml
- id: extract_content
  tool: headless-browser
  action: scrape
  parameters:
    url: "{{ search_topic.results[0].url if ... else deep_search.results[0].url ... }}"
  dependencies:
    - search_topic
    - deep_search
  condition: "{{ (search_topic.results | length > 0) or (deep_search.results | length > 0) }}"
```

The `extract_content` task:
1. Depends on `search_topic` and `deep_search`
2. Has a condition that uses results from those dependencies
3. Has a URL parameter that also uses those results

### Current Approach
I'm working on simplifying the JIT rendering to:
1. Let tasks execute in dependency order
2. Render templates on-demand in the control system
3. For conditional tasks, delay condition evaluation until dependencies complete

### Next Steps
1. Modify conditional task execution to handle deferred condition evaluation
2. Ensure proper error handling when templates can't be rendered
3. Add comprehensive tests for various template scenarios

The implementation is close to working - basic pipelines work fine, and the template analysis is correctly identifying dependencies. The remaining work is handling the interaction between conditional execution and template rendering.
