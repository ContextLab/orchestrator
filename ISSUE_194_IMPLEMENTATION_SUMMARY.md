# Issue 194: Complex Model Requirements Specification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive support for detailed model requirements specification including size, expertise level, capabilities, cost constraints, and performance requirements. The implementation follows the approved plan with NO MOCK TESTS - all functionality is tested with real components and integration tests.

## âœ… Completed Implementation

   - Added `modalities` for multimodal requirements ("text", "vision", "code", "audio")
   - Added enhanced cost constraints (`cost_limit`, `budget_period`)
   - Added `fallback_strategy` for intelligent fallbacks

2. **Enhanced ModelRegistry._filter_by_capabilities()** (`src/orchestrator/models/model_registry.py:312-344`)
   - Added `_meets_expertise_level()` method with hierarchical expertise checking
   - Added `_meets_cost_constraint()` method for budget period enforcement
   - Integrated size parsing and performance constraint filtering

3. **Extended model_utils.parse_model_size()** (`src/orchestrator/utils/model_utils.py`)
   - Enhanced decimal support and patterns (e.g., "1.5B", "3.7B")
   - Added `compare_model_sizes()` and `validate_size_string()` functions
   - Improved error handling and edge case support

4. **Updated YAML Schema Validation** (`src/orchestrator/compiler/schema_validator.py:133-201`)

   - Validation for fallback strategies and performance metrics

### Phase 2: Advanced Functionality

#### Phase 2.1: Enhanced ModelSelector Logic
- **Enhanced `_score_models()` method** (`src/orchestrator/models/model_selector.py:546-674`)
  - Integrated expertise level scoring via `_score_expertise_match()`
  - Added modality matching via `_score_modality_match()`

- **Added Helper Methods**:
  - `_score_expertise_match()`: Scores models based on expertise level alignment
  - `_score_modality_match()`: Scores multimodal capability matches
  - `_estimate_model_cost()`: Estimates costs for different budget periods

#### Phase 2.2: Extended ModelCost Calculations
Enhanced `ModelCost` class (`src/orchestrator/core/model.py:153-272`) with:
- `estimate_cost_for_budget_period()`: Cost estimation for "per-task", "per-pipeline", "per-hour"
- `get_cost_efficiency_score()`: Performance-per-dollar calculations
- `compare_cost_with()`: Detailed cost comparisons between models
- `is_within_budget()`: Budget compliance checking
- `get_cost_breakdown()`: Detailed cost component analysis

#### Phase 2.3: Capability Detection Methods
Added comprehensive capability analysis to `ModelRegistry` (`src/orchestrator/models/model_registry.py:380-719`):
- `detect_model_capabilities()`: Complete model capability analysis
- `_analyze_model_expertise()`: Expertise area categorization and scoring
- `_analyze_model_cost()`: Cost tier classification and efficiency analysis
- `_calculate_suitability_scores()`: Task-specific suitability scoring
- `find_models_by_capability()`: Capability-based model discovery
- `get_capability_matrix()`: Complete capability overview
- `recommend_models_for_task()`: Natural language task-based recommendations

    action: analyze_code
    requires_model:
      expertise: "high"
      modalities: ["code"]
      min_size: "7B"
      max_size: "70B"
      cost_limit: 0.1

```python
# Create selection criteria
criteria = ModelSelectionCriteria(
    expertise="high",
    modalities=["code", "vision"],
    cost_limit=1.0,
    budget_period="per-pipeline",
    fallback_strategy="cheapest"
)

# Select optimal model
model = await selector.select_model(criteria)

# Get cost analysis
cost_breakdown = model.cost.get_cost_breakdown(1000, 500)
efficiency = model.cost.get_cost_efficiency_score(0.9)

# Get capability analysis
analysis = registry.detect_model_capabilities(model)
recommendations = registry.recommend_models_for_task("Debug Python code")
```
