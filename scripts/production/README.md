python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --mode=validate-all

# CI/CD validation
python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --mode=cicd-validate
```

### Deployment Modes
```bash
# Full production deployment
python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --mode=deploy

# Component-specific deployment
python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --mode=deploy-component --component=validation
```

### Monitoring Modes
```bash
# Health check
python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --mode=health-check

# Performance monitoring
python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --mode=monitor
```

### Reporting Modes
```bash
# Generate deployment report
python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --mode=show-report

# Specific report by ID
python scripts/production/production_deploy.py --report-id=<deployment_id>
```
