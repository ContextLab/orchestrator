## How to Adapt This for Real Users

To use this conversation pattern with actual users instead of simulated ones:

1. **Replace User Steps**: Remove all steps that use "openai/gpt-4o-mini" for user simulation
2. **Add User Input Collection**: Use a web interface, CLI prompt, or chat widget to collect real user messages
3. **Maintain Context**: Store conversation history in a session to maintain context between exchanges
4. **Add Features**:
   - User authentication
   - Conversation persistence
   - Export functionality
   - Rating system for responses

### Example Implementation:
```python
# Instead of AI-generated user message:
user_message = await get_user_input("What would you like to learn about?")

# Process with the same bot logic:
bot_response = await bot_model.generate(user_message, context=conversation_history)
```

*This demonstration shows how AI models can simulate educational conversations. The same pattern can be applied with real users for interactive learning experiences.*
