## Overview

The **DataFlow Pipeline** is a robust framework designed for processing data in an efficient and modular way. It allows developers to create complex data processing workflows made up of individual tasks that can be executed in a structured manner. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and utilizing the DataFlow Pipeline in your projects.

## Getting Started

To begin using the DataFlow Pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install the DataFlow Pipeline package using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install dataflow
    ```

2. **Creating Your First Pipeline**:
    - Import the necessary classes from the library.
    - Define your tasks by extending the `Task` class.
    - Create an instance of `Pipeline` and add your tasks to it.
  
3. **Running the Pipeline**: After setting up your pipeline, you can run it with your input data.

For detailed instructions, refer to the API Documentation section.

## API Documentation

The DataFlow Pipeline API provides various classes and methods to facilitate the creation and management of your data processing pipelines.

### Key Classes

- **Pipeline**: The main class that represents the data processing pipeline. It manages tasks and execution flow.
  
- **Task**: Base class for all tasks in the pipeline. Users must extend this class to define their custom processing logic.

### Methods

- **add_task(task: Task)**: Adds a task to the pipeline.
  
- **run(data)**: Executes the pipeline with the provided input data.

Refer to the API documentation for a complete list of methods and their descriptions.

## Examples

This section provides practical examples to demonstrate the usage and capabilities of the **DataFlow Pipeline**. Each example highlights different features and best practices to help you effectively implement and utilize the DataFlow Pipeline in your projects.

### 1. Basic Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to create a simple data processing pipeline that processes a list of numbers by doubling each number.

```python
from dataflow import Pipeline, Task

# Define a simple task to double numbers
class DoubleTask(Task):
    def run(self, data):
        return [x * 2 for x in data]

# Create a pipeline and add the task
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_task(DoubleTask())

# Input data
input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Run the pipeline
output_data = pipeline.run(input_data)
print(output_data)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### 2. Chaining Tasks Example

This example shows how to chain multiple tasks in a single pipeline to process data in stages.

```python
class AddTask(Task):
    def run(self, data):
        return [x + 1 for x in data]

# Create a new pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_task(DoubleTask())
pipeline.add_task(AddTask())

# Input data
input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Run the pipeline
output_data = pipeline.run(input_data)
print(output_data)  # Output: [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
```

### 3. Parallel Execution Example

This example illustrates how to configure tasks to run in parallel, improving performance for data-intensive applications.

```python
# Assuming your tasks can be run in parallel, configure tasks accordingly
# For demonstration, please refer to the library's parallel execution capabilities.
```

### 4. Real-time Data Processing Example

This example presents a scenario where the pipeline processes data in real-time, ideal for streaming applications.

```python
# Implementation details for real-time processing would go here.
```

### 5. Error Handling Example

This example showcases how to implement error handling within the DataFlow Pipeline to manage unexpected issues effectively.

```python
from dataflow import Pipeline, Task

# Task that may raise an exception
class RiskyTask(Task):
    def run(self, data):
        if not data:
            raise ValueError("Input data cannot be empty.")
        return [x * 2 for x in data]

# Create a pipeline and add the risky task
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_task(RiskyTask())

# Input data
try:
    output_data = pipeline.run([])
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Output: Error: Input data cannot be empty.
```
