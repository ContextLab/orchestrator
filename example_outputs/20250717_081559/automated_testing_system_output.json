Test Plan Objectives:\nTo validate the functionality, performance, and usability of the web app. The test is designed to identify any issues or bugs that may affect the user experience or the functionality of the app.\n\n2. Features to be tested: \n- User registration and login\n- Data input and output\n- Navigation through the app\n- Performance under load\n- Security measures, such as encryption of user data\n- Compatibility with different browsers and devices\n\n3. Features not to be tested:\n- The backend database beyond its interaction with the app\n- The server beyond its hosting of the app\n\n4. Approach:\n- Manual testing will be used for usability and navigational testing.\n- Automated testing will be used for load testing and repeated tasks.\n- White box testing will be employed to verify the internal workings of the app.\n- Black-box testing will be used to verify the app\u2019s functionality without concerning the internal codings.\n\n5. Pass/Fail Criteria:\n- The app shall pass if it fulfills its intended functions without any major bugs or issues that affect functionality or user experience.\n- The app shall fail if any critical bugs are found, or if it fails to deliver on its intended functions.\n\n6. Suspension Criteria:\n- Testing will be suspended if a critical bug is found that prevents further testing.\n- If the app crashes under load testing, testing will be suspended until this issue is resolved.\n\n7. Resumption Requirements:\n- Once the critical bugs have been fixed and the app is stable, testing will resume from the point of suspension.\n\n8. Test Deliverables:\n- Test cases\n- Bug reports\n- Test summary report\n\n9. Testing tasks:\n- Creating and executing test cases\n- Logging and tracking bugs\n- Reviewing and analyzing test results\n- Reporting on findings\n\n10. Environmental Needs:\n- Various browsers for compatibility testing\n- Devices of different screen sizes for responsive testing\n- Test accounts for user experience testing\n\n11. Responsibilities:\n- Tester is responsible for executing the test cases and reporting bugs.\n- Developer is responsible for fixing the bugs reported and making necessary changes.\n- Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the entire process and ensuring that the objectives are met.\n\n12. Schedule:\nThe schedule will be determined based on the project deadlines and availability of resources. \n\n13. Risks and Contingencies:\n- Potential risks include discovery of major bugs close to the delivery date, which might delay the project.\n- Contingency plans include allocating extra time for testing at the end of the project to accommodate for any unexpected issues.\n\n14. Approvals:\nThe test plan must be approved by the Project Manager and the Lead Developer before testing can commence. \n\n15. Glossary:\n- Bug: An error or defect in the app that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result.\n- Load testing: Testing an app under heavy loads, such as testing a website with large amounts of traffic.\n- Usability: How user-friendly the app is.",
    "generate_unit_tests": "No\n\nTest Objectives:\n\n1. To verify the functionality of the application under different scenarios.\n2. To check the performance of the application under heavy load.\n3. To ensure the compatibility of the application with different devices/operating systems.\n4. To validate the security features of the application.\n5. To test the user interface and user experience of the application.\n\nTest Scope:\n\n1. All functional features of the application.\n2. Performance testing under different load conditions.\n3. Compatibility testing with different devices and operating systems.\n4. Security testing to ensure data privacy and protection.\n5. UI/UX testing for user-friendliness.\n\nOut of Scope:\n\n1. Testing on devices/operating systems not specified in the requirements.\n2. Testing features not yet implemented or outside the agreed scope.\n\nTest Approach:\n\n1. Manual testing for functional and UI/UX testing.\n2. Automated testing for performance and compatibility testing.\n3. Penetration testing for security features.\n\nTest Environment:\n\n1. Different devices and operating systems as specified in the requirements.\n2. Test server to simulate different load conditions.\n\nTest Data:\n\n1. Test data will be generated as per the requirements of each test case.\n\nEntry Criteria:\n\n1. All features to be tested are implemented.\n2. Test environment is set up and ready.\n3. Test data is ready.\n\nExit Criteria:\n\n1. All test cases are executed.\n2. All critical defects are fixed and retested.\n3. Test report is ready.\n\nTest Deliverables:\n\n1. Test plan.\n2. Test cases.\n3. Test scripts (for automated testing).\n4. Test data.\n5. Bug reports.\n6. Test summary report.",
