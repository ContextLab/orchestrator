# GitHub Issue Update - JIT Template Rendering Progress

## Issue #184 - Template Rendering in research_advanced_tools.yaml

### Summary
Successfully implemented the foundation for Just-In-Time (JIT) template rendering. The core infrastructure is in place and working for most pipelines.

### Key Commits
- `19b0778` - debug: Add immediate result registration and extensive debugging for template rendering issue
- `d5e4463` - fix: Preserve tool metadata for conditional tasks in control flow compiler
- `50577c6` - fix: Ensure conditional task conditions are evaluated after dependencies are satisfied
- `d29b519` - fix: Add debug logging for template rendering in filesystem operations

### What's Working
1. **Template Dependency Analysis** ✅
   - Created `TemplateMetadata` class to track template dependencies
   - YAMLCompiler analyzes templates during compilation
   - Dependencies are correctly identified and tracked

2. **Conditional Task Execution** ✅
   - Fixed timing issue where conditions were evaluated before dependencies completed
   - Conditions containing templates are now rendered before evaluation
   - Proper error handling for condition failures

3. **Basic Pipeline Support** ✅
   - `research_minimal.yaml` - All templates render correctly
   - `research_basic.yaml` - All templates render correctly

### Current Status
The `research_advanced_tools.yaml` pipeline runs without errors but still has an issue with template rendering in the final report. The markdown file contains unrendered templates like `{{ topic }}` and `{{ analyze_findings.result }}`.

### Investigation Results
1. The control system correctly preserves the `content` parameter for filesystem write operations
2. The `_template_manager` is being passed to the filesystem tool
3. The filesystem tool has logic to render templates at runtime
4. Basic pipelines work correctly, suggesting the issue is specific to how advanced pipelines handle template context

### Next Steps
1. Investigate why template context is not available for advanced pipeline filesystem writes
2. Add unit tests for template analysis and rendering
3. Complete documentation for JIT template rendering

## Issue #153 - Pipeline Quality Control

### Summary
Two out of three research pipelines are now working correctly with proper template rendering.

### Pipeline Status
- **research_minimal.yaml** ✅ - All templates render correctly, output is properly formatted
- **research_basic.yaml** ✅ - All templates render correctly, comprehensive report generated
- **research_advanced_tools.yaml** ⚠️ - Runs without errors but filesystem write templates not rendering

### Quality Improvements
1. Fixed conditional task evaluation timing
2. Improved error handling and logging
3. Verified output directory structure is correct

## Issue #183 - Conditional Task Execution

### Summary
Successfully fixed the conditional task execution issue where conditions were being evaluated before dependencies completed.

### Solution
Modified `orchestrator.py` to check that all task dependencies are satisfied before evaluating conditions. This prevents errors like "name 'search_topic' is not defined" when evaluating conditional expressions.

### Technical Details
- Added dependency checking in `_execute_task_with_resources`
- Enhanced `ConditionalTask.should_execute()` to render condition templates
- Improved error messages for condition evaluation failures

## Remaining Work
1. Fix template rendering in `research_advanced_tools.yaml` filesystem writes
2. Add comprehensive unit tests
3. Update documentation
4. Improve error messages for template vs task dependencies
