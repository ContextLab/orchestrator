# Task: Visual Output Validation

## Description
Implement automated validation for visual outputs including images, charts, and reports. Create basic analysis capabilities for file validation, format checking, content detection, and integration with existing image processing capabilities in the orchestrator.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic image generation verification (existence, format, size validation)
- [ ] Basic image analysis (color distribution, content detection, corruption checks)
- [ ] Chart and visualization validation (axis labels, data presence, format integrity)
- [ ] Report formatting validation (markdown structure, section completeness)
- [ ] Integration with existing orchestrator image processing capabilities
- [ ] Visual diff comparison capabilities for regression detection
- [ ] Support for multiple image formats and chart types

## Technical Details
- **Integration**: Leverage existing orchestrator image processing and PIL/OpenCV capabilities
- **Analysis**: File format validation, basic content analysis, structural checks
- **Charts**: Validation of generated charts for completeness and data integrity
- **Reports**: Markdown structure validation, section presence checks
- **Formats**: Support PNG, JPG, SVG for images; validate CSV, JSON, MD for reports
- **Performance**: Efficient processing to minimize validation time overhead

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Organized repository structure for consistent visual output location
- [ ] Analysis of existing image processing capabilities in orchestrator
- [ ] Visual validation criteria definition for different output types
- [ ] Integration points with quality assessment framework

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 18-22 hours  
- **Parallel**: true (can run with 002, 003 after 001)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Visual output validation system implemented
- [ ] All visual output types supported (images, charts, reports)
- [ ] Basic content analysis operational for quality assessment
- [ ] Integration with enhanced validation engine complete
- [ ] Visual diff capabilities for regression detection
- [ ] Performance optimized for minimal validation overhead
