- [x] **Build automated test suite** for organization standards
- [x] **Implement validation reporting** for continuous compliance

#### Phase 3: Automated Reporting System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create organization health dashboard** with real-time metrics
- [x] **Build automated compliance reports** for regular review
- [x] **Implement trend analysis** for repository organization health
- [x] **Create integration with existing validation/testing workflows**

#### Phase 4: Long-term Maintenance Procedures ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Establish automated cleanup schedules** for regular maintenance
- [x] **Create maintenance documentation** for ongoing organization
- [x] **Build self-healing capabilities** for minor organization violations
- [x] **Implement backup/recovery procedures** for organization failures

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on automation and monitoring (not manual reorganization)
- Build on proven safety framework from Streams A & B
- Integrate with existing validation/testing infrastructure
- Commit frequently with: "Issue #255: {specific change}"

### Success Criteria
- Automated monitoring system operational
- Validation procedures integrated into workflows
- Reporting dashboard functional with real-time metrics
- Maintenance procedures documented and tested
