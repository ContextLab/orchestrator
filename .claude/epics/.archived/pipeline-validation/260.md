# Task: Performance Monitoring & Baselines

## Description
Implement performance monitoring and regression detection system using existing orchestrator infrastructure. Establish baselines, track execution times, monitor resource usage, and detect performance regressions with automated alerting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Baseline management system for each pipeline's performance metrics
- [ ] Execution time tracking with statistical analysis (mean, median, p95, p99)
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, API calls where available)
- [ ] Automated regression detection with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Cost tracking for API-dependent pipelines with budget alerts
- [ ] Historical trending and comparison reporting
- [ ] Integration with existing checkpoint system for baseline storage

## Technical Details
- **Baselines**: Leverage existing checkpoint system for storing performance baselines
- **Monitoring**: Extend existing execution time tracking with comprehensive metrics
- **Regression**: Automated comparison with historical baselines and alerting
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor API usage and costs with budget threshold alerts
- **Storage**: JSON-based metrics storage integrated with existing data systems
- **Reporting**: Performance dashboards and trend analysis with visual reporting

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Repository organization for consistent performance data storage
- [ ] Task 002: Enhanced validation engine integration for performance collection
- [ ] Analysis of existing monitoring infrastructure and extension points
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment methodology

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 18-22 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run with 005, 007)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance monitoring system implemented with comprehensive metrics
- [ ] Baseline management operational with automated updates
- [ ] Regression detection alerts working with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Cost tracking and budget monitoring active for API-dependent pipelines
- [ ] Historical trending and reporting dashboards available
- [ ] Integration with existing infrastructure validated
