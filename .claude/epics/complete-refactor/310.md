# Task: YAML Pipeline Specification

## Overview
Implement comprehensive YAML parsing, validation, and StateGraph compilation capabilities. This task builds upon the core architecture foundation to provide robust pipeline definition and compilation features.

## Objectives
- Implement comprehensive YAML pipeline parsing
- Build validation system for pipeline specifications
- Create StateGraph compilation from YAML definitions
- Establish pipeline schema and validation rules

## Dependencies
- [001] Core Architecture Foundation (must be completed first)

## Parallel Processing
- Cannot be parallelized with core architecture work
- Depends on interfaces and patterns established in task 001

## Estimated Size
Large (5-7 days)

## Key Components
1. **YAML Parser**: Robust parsing of pipeline definition files
2. **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive validation of pipeline structure and content
3. **StateGraph Compiler**: Transform YAML definitions into executable StateGraphs
4. **Pipeline Schema**: Define formal schema for pipeline specifications
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid pipeline definitions

## Success Criteria
- YAML pipelines can be parsed and validated
- Valid pipelines compile to executable StateGraphs
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid specifications
- Schema documentation is complete and accurate
- All parsing and validation tests pass

## Notes
This task requires the architectural foundation from task 001 to be in place, particularly the pipeline compiler interfaces and LangGraph integration patterns.
