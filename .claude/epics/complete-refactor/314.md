# Task 006: Quality Control System

## Description
Build comprehensive automated output validation, logging, and quality control reporting systems to ensure pipeline outputs meet quality standards and provide actionable insights.

## Objectives
- Design and implement automated output validation system with configurable rules
- Create comprehensive logging framework for pipeline execution and debugging
- Build quality control reporting with metrics, analytics, and trend analysis
- Implement validation rule engine for flexible quality checks
- Create alerting system for quality threshold breaches
- Design quality dashboard for monitoring and insights

## Dependencies
- [001] Core Architecture (needs foundational structure and interfaces)
- [005] Execution Engine (needs pipeline execution context for validation)

## Parallelization
- **Parallel**: true - Can work alongside other infrastructure systems
- Depends on execution engine but can be developed concurrently with tool management
- Quality validation logic can be designed independently of specific tools

## Size & Estimation
- **Size**: M (Medium complexity)
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days
- Involves validation logic, reporting systems, and quality metrics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Automated output validation catches quality issues reliably
- [ ] Comprehensive logging provides detailed execution insights
- [ ] Quality control reporting delivers actionable metrics and trends
- [ ] Validation rule engine supports flexible and extensible quality checks
- [ ] Alerting system notifies stakeholders of quality threshold breaches
- [ ] Quality dashboard provides clear monitoring and insights interface

## Implementation Notes
- Design validation rules to be configurable and extensible
- Implement structured logging with appropriate verbosity levels
- Consider integration with external monitoring and alerting systems
- Plan for both real-time and batch quality analysis
- Focus on actionable insights rather than just data collection
- Design with performance considerations for high-volume pipelines
