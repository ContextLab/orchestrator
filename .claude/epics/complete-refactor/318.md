# Task: Documentation & Examples

## Overview
Create complete documentation and example pipelines demonstrating new architecture. This final task ensures users can effectively adopt and utilize the refactored system through comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and practical examples.

## Objectives
- Create comprehensive API documentation for new architecture
- Develop tutorial series for common pipeline patterns
- Build extensive example library showcasing system capabilities
- Update all existing documentation to reflect new architecture
- Create migration guide for users transitioning from old system

## Dependencies
- 007: API Interface (needs working API to document)
- 008: Repository Migration (needs migrated system to document)

## Parallel Processing
- Can be parallelized with testing and validation (009)
- Independent documentation work can proceed alongside testing
- Enables early user adoption preparation

## Estimated Size
Small (1-2 days)

## Key Components
1. **API Documentation**: Comprehensive reference for all public interfaces
2. **Tutorial Series**: Step-by-step guides for common use cases
3. **Example Library**: Diverse pipeline examples demonstrating capabilities
4. **Migration Guide**: Instructions for transitioning from old to new architecture
5. **Best Practices Guide**: Recommendations for optimal pipeline design
6. **Troubleshooting Documentation**: Common issues and solutions

## Success Criteria
- Complete API reference documentation is available
- Tutorial series covers all major use cases
- Example library includes diverse, working pipeline examples
- Migration guide enables smooth transition for existing users
- All documentation is accurate and up-to-date with final system
- Examples run successfully on all supported platforms

## Notes
This task runs in parallel with testing, allowing documentation to be refined based on testing findings. Focus on practical, actionable guidance that enables rapid user adoption of the new architecture.
