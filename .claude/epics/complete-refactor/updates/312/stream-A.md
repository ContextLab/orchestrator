## Stream Assignment
- **Stream A**: Tool Registry & Discovery
- **Files to modify**: `src/orchestrator/tools/registry.py`, `src/orchestrator/tools/__init__.py`  
- **Work scope**: Tool registry system for discovering and managing available tools, tool versioning and compatibility checking, extensible registry design for easy tool addition

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Architecture Analysis
- Analyzed existing tool registry infrastructure:
  - `universal_registry.py`: Multi-source tool registration (orchestrator, LangChain, MCP)
  - `discovery.py`: Pattern-based tool discovery engine
  - `__init__.py`: Basic tool exports
- Identified enhancement opportunities for versioning, compatibility, and extensibility

### ✅ Enhanced Registry System Implementation
- **Created**: `src/orchestrator/tools/registry.py`
  - `EnhancedToolRegistry` class extending `UniversalToolRegistry`
  - Comprehensive tool metadata with `EnhancedToolMetadata`
  - Version management with `VersionInfo` class and semantic versioning
  - Compatibility checking with `CompatibilityRequirement`
  - Security policies with `SecurityPolicy` and `SecurityLevel` enums
  - Installation management with `InstallationRequirement` and status tracking
  - Extensibility support with plugin interfaces and extension registry
  - Performance monitoring and metrics collection

### ✅ Version Management System
- **Features implemented**:
  - Semantic version parsing and comparison using `packaging.version`
  - Version compatibility validation
  - Tool upgrade/downgrade capabilities
  - Deprecation management with migration paths
  - Version registry with historical tracking

### ✅ Compatibility Checking
- **Features implemented**:
  - Dependency validation with version constraints
  - Conflict detection between tools
  - System compatibility reporting
  - Cached compatibility results for performance
  - Required capability validation

### ✅ Security Framework
- **Features implemented**:
  - Multi-level security policies (STRICT, MODERATE, PERMISSIVE, TRUSTED)
  - Operation allowlist/blocklist per security level
  - Tool blocking/unblocking with audit trail
  - Security hash generation for tool integrity
  - Sandboxed execution support integration

### ✅ Installation Management
- **Features implemented**:
  - Installation requirement specification
  - Status tracking (AVAILABLE, NEEDS_INSTALL, INSTALLING, FAILED, UNAVAILABLE)
  - Installation callbacks for workflow coordination
  - Package manager integration support (pip, npm, apt)
  - Post-install command execution

### ✅ Extensibility Design  
- **Features implemented**:
  - Plugin interface registration system
  - Extension registry for tool enhancements
  - Configuration schema support
  - Tool relationship tracking (provides/requires/conflicts/supersedes)
  - Extension point definitions

### ✅ Updated Module Exports
- **Enhanced**: `src/orchestrator/tools/__init__.py`
  - Added all new registry system exports
  - Maintained backward compatibility
  - Organized exports by functional area
  - Added convenience functions for simple use cases

## Key Implementation Features

### Core Registry Classes
```python
- EnhancedToolRegistry: Main registry with full feature set
- EnhancedToolMetadata: Comprehensive tool metadata
- VersionInfo: Semantic versioning support  
- CompatibilityRequirement: Dependency specification
- SecurityPolicy: Multi-level security framework
- InstallationRequirement: Installation management
```

### Enums for Type Safety
```python
- RegistrationStatus: Tool lifecycle states
- SecurityLevel: Security policy levels
- InstallationStatus: Installation tracking
```

### Convenience Functions
```python
- register_tool_simple(): Easy tool registration
- discover_tools_for_action(): Action-based discovery
- check_tool_compatibility(): Version compatibility
```

## Coordination Support

### For Stream B (Automatic Setup & Installation)
- Installation requirement definitions with package manager support
- Installation status tracking and callback system  
- Tool metadata includes all setup information needed
- Integration points for installation workflow automation

### For Stream C (Dependency & Resource Management)
- Comprehensive dependency specification with version constraints
- Tool relationship modeling (provides/requires/conflicts)
- Resource requirement tracking and validation
- Compatibility checking and conflict resolution

## Performance & Monitoring
- Execution time tracking per tool
- Success rate monitoring  
- Usage statistics collection
- Performance metrics export/import
- Caching for expensive compatibility checks

## Security Considerations  
- Multi-level security policies with granular controls
- Tool integrity verification via security hashes
- Blocked tool enforcement with audit trails
- Sandboxed execution integration
- Operation-level permission validation

## Extensibility Features
- Plugin interface registration for custom tool types
- Extension registry for tool enhancements  
- Configuration schema support for tool customization
- Export/import of complete registry state
- Tool relationship modeling for ecosystem management

## Next Steps for Other Streams

### Stream B Dependencies Met
- ✅ Installation requirement specification
- ✅ Installation status tracking
- ✅ Package manager integration hooks
- ✅ Installation callback system

### Stream C Dependencies Met  
- ✅ Dependency specification framework
- ✅ Tool relationship modeling
- ✅ Compatibility validation system
- ✅ Resource requirement tracking

## Files Modified
1. **Created**: `/Users/jmanning/epic-complete-refactor/src/orchestrator/tools/registry.py` (1,244 lines)
   - Complete enhanced registry implementation
   - All versioning, compatibility, and extensibility features
   
2. **Updated**: `/Users/jmanning/epic-complete-refactor/src/orchestrator/tools/__init__.py`
   - Added enhanced registry exports
   - Maintained backward compatibility
   - Added convenience function exports

## Architecture Impact
- Extends existing `UniversalToolRegistry` without breaking changes
- Integrates seamlessly with existing `ToolDiscoveryEngine`
- Provides foundation for automated installation and dependency management
- Enables plugin ecosystem development
- Supports enterprise-grade tool lifecycle management

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

Stream A work is complete. The enhanced tool registry system provides:
- ✅ Comprehensive tool discovery and management
- ✅ Robust version management and compatibility checking  
- ✅ Extensible design for easy tool addition
- ✅ Security considerations throughout
- ✅ Foundation for Stream B (installation) and Stream C (dependencies)
- ✅ Performance monitoring and enterprise features

Ready for coordination with other streams and integration testing.
