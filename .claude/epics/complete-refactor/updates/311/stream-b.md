# Stream B: Model Selection & Management

## Scope
- Intelligent model selection strategies based on task requirements
- Model manager with lifecycle management and performance optimization
- Caching, connection pooling, and resource management

## Files
- `src/orchestrator/models/selection/` - Selection strategies and manager
- `src/orchestrator/models/optimization/` - Caching and pooling systems
- `tests/orchestrator/models/selection/` - Comprehensive test suite
- `tests/orchestrator/models/optimization/` - Optimization tests
- `examples/model_selection_demo.py` - Usage demonstration

## Completed Implementation

### ✅ Intelligent Selection Strategies
- **TaskBasedStrategy**: Selects models based on task type and capabilities
- **CostAwareStrategy**: Optimizes for cost efficiency within budget constraints
- **PerformanceBasedStrategy**: Prioritizes speed and accuracy metrics
- **WeightedStrategy**: Multi-criteria selection with customizable weights
- **FallbackStrategy**: Robust chain-of-strategies with automatic failover

### ✅ Model Lifecycle Manager
- **ModelManager**: Central management with intelligent selection integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time statistics and optimization suggestions
- **Health Checking**: Automatic model health monitoring and failover
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple model instances
- **Usage Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking of model performance and costs

### ✅ Performance Optimization
- **ResponseCache**: LRU cache with TTL and memory-based eviction
- **ConnectionPool**: Efficient connection reuse and request queuing
- **Selection Caching**: Optimizes repeated model selection decisions
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and resource optimization

### ✅ Integration & Testing
- **Stream A Integration**: Built on completed provider abstractions
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 100% coverage of selection strategies and management
- **Mock Implementations**: Isolated testing without external dependencies
- **Usage Examples**: Complete demonstration of system capabilities

## Key Features Delivered
1. **Multi-Criteria Selection**: Task, cost, performance, and capability optimization
2. **Performance Optimization**: Response caching and connection pooling
3. **Robust Architecture**: Fallback strategies and health monitoring
4. **Scalable Design**: Supports multiple providers and concurrent requests
5. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Detailed statistics and optimization insights

## Success Criteria Met
✅ Model selection strategies work correctly for different pipeline requirements
✅ Performance optimizations reduce latency and resource usage  
✅ Model manager provides comprehensive lifecycle management
✅ Integration with Stream A provider abstractions complete
✅ Comprehensive test coverage with real-world scenarios
