# Stream A: Core API Interface

## Scope
- Main API interface for pipeline operations (compile, execute, status)
- Clean, intuitive method signatures and documentation
- Integration with all completed components

## Files
- `src/orchestrator/api/core.py`
- `src/orchestrator/api/__init__.py`

## Progress
- Starting implementation

## Completed
- Created API directory structure
- Implemented complete PipelineAPI class with all required methods:
  - compile_pipeline(): Integrates with YAML compiler, handles file/string input, comprehensive validation
  - execute_pipeline(): Creates execution manager, handles context injection, real-time monitoring
  - get_execution_status(): Provides comprehensive status including progress, metrics, recovery info
  - stop_execution(): Graceful and immediate stopping of executions
  - list_active_executions(): Lists all running executions
  - get_compilation_report(): Detailed validation results from compilation
  - validate_yaml(): Quick validation without full compilation
  - get_template_variables(): Extract template variables from YAML
  - cleanup_execution(): Resource cleanup for completed executions
  - shutdown(): Graceful API shutdown with resource cleanup
- Added comprehensive error handling with custom exception classes
- Integrated with all foundation components:
  - YAML compiler with full validation pipeline
  - Execution engine with comprehensive execution manager
  - Model registry for AUTO tag resolution
  - Variable management and state persistence
  - Progress tracking and recovery mechanisms
- Created __init__.py with proper exports and convenience functions
- Added context manager support for automatic cleanup
- Designed user-friendly method signatures that hide architectural complexity

## Architecture Integration
- Successfully integrated YAMLCompiler with full validation pipeline
- Connected to ComprehensiveExecutionManager for execution orchestration
- Leveraged model registry for ambiguity resolution
- Used validation reporting for detailed compilation feedback
- Implemented execution state tracking and management

## API Design Highlights
- Clean, intuitive method names and signatures
- Flexible input handling (string, Path, Pipeline objects)
- Comprehensive status reporting with nested progress information
- Resource management with automatic cleanup
- Context manager pattern for safe API usage
- Backwards compatibility aliases

## Next Steps
- Ready for Stream B (Pipeline Operations) integration
- Ready for Stream C (Error Handling & Documentation) documentation

## Blocked
- None

## Notes
- All foundation components are properly integrated
- API provides clean abstraction while maintaining full framework capabilities
- Error handling covers all failure modes with appropriate exception types
- Status tracking provides detailed execution visibility
