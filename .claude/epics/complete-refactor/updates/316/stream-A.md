# Stream A: Component Migration & Import Path Updates

## Scope
- Systematic replacement of old architecture components
- Update all import paths and references throughout codebase
- Component-by-component migration with fallback support

## Files
- `src/orchestrator/__init__.py`
- Legacy component replacements throughout codebase
- Import path updates across all modules

## Progress
- ✅ Analyzed current orchestrator structure vs new architecture
- ✅ Mapped foundation module to new api module structure  
- ✅ Copied new API module to current orchestrator
- ✅ Replaced foundation imports in execution/engine.py
- ✅ Fixed circular import issues with compatibility layer
- ✅ Updated main __init__.py with new API exports
- ✅ Copied missing execution modules and restored engine
- ✅ Tested complete migration functionality
- ✅ Committed migrated components

## Migration Summary
Successfully completed the core component migration phase:
- **Added comprehensive API module**: PipelineAPI, AdvancedPipelineCompiler, PipelineExecutor
- **Replaced foundation module**: Created compatibility layer maintaining backward compatibility
- **Enhanced execution module**: Added state management, progress tracking, and recovery mechanisms
- **Zero breaking changes**: All existing functionality preserved during transition
- **Full API availability**: New components available via main orchestrator module

## Key Achievements
- Complete foundation → API/execution migration
- Backward compatibility maintained via compatibility layer
- Circular import issues resolved through lazy loading
- All major components tested and working
- Clean commit with comprehensive migration

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Core component migration successful. Ready for Stream B (Backward Compatibility) and Stream C (Testing Integration).
