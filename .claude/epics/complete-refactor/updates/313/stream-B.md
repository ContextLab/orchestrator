## Stream B: Variable & State Management

### Scope
- Files to modify: src/orchestrator/execution/state.py, src/orchestrator/execution/variables.py
- Work to complete: Variable management system for data flow, state persistence and context management, execution context isolation

### Completed Implementation

**✅ Variable Management System (`variables.py`)**
- **VariableManager**: Comprehensive variable storage, retrieval, scoping, and dependency tracking
- **VariableMetadata**: Rich metadata system with versioning, timestamps, and type classification
- **Variable Scoping**: Support for global, step, loop, and temporary variable scopes
- **Context Isolation**: Thread-safe context management with isolated variable namespaces  
- **Template Resolution**: Dynamic template system with ${var} placeholder resolution and caching
- **Dependency Tracking**: Variable dependency graphs with circular dependency detection
- **Event System**: Variable creation and change event handlers for real-time notifications
- **Thread Safety**: Full threading support with RLock protection for concurrent access
- **State Persistence**: Complete export/import of variable state for recovery and debugging

**✅ Execution Context Management (`state.py`)**
- **ExecutionContext**: Comprehensive execution environment with lifecycle management
- **State Persistence**: Multiple format support (JSON, Pickle, compressed variants)
- **Checkpoint System**: Automatic checkpoint creation and restoration capabilities
- **Metrics Tracking**: Detailed execution metrics with timing, completion rates, and success tracking
- **Nested Contexts**: Support for sub-pipeline execution with parent-child relationships
- **Status Management**: Full execution lifecycle (pending, running, paused, completed, failed, cancelled)
- **Event Handling**: Step-level and status change event notifications
- **Context Manager**: Python context manager support for clean resource management

**✅ Integration Bridge (`integration.py`)**
