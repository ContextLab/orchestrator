# Task 004: Tool & Resource Management

## Description
Create comprehensive tool registry, automatic setup, and dependency handling systems to manage all external tools and resources required by pipeline execution.

## Objectives
- Design and implement tool registry system for discovering and managing available tools
- Create automatic setup mechanisms for tool installation and configuration
- Build dependency handling system to ensure all required resources are available
- Implement tool versioning and compatibility checking
- Create resource management for efficient tool lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- [001] Core Architecture (needs foundational structure and interfaces)

## Parallelization
- **Parallel**: true - Can work alongside other infrastructure components
- Can be developed concurrently with execution engine and quality control systems
- Interfaces with core architecture but doesn't block other development

## Size & Estimation
- **Size**: M (Medium complexity)
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days
- Involves registry design, automatic setup logic, and dependency resolution

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Tool registry can discover and catalog available tools
- [ ] Automatic setup successfully installs and configures tools
- [ ] Dependency handling resolves and manages all required resources
- [ ] Tool versioning prevents compatibility issues
- [ ] Resource management optimizes tool lifecycle and cleanup

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on extensible registry design for easy tool addition
- Implement robust dependency resolution algorithms
- Consider containerization for tool isolation
- Plan for both local and remote tool management
- Design with security and sandboxing considerations
