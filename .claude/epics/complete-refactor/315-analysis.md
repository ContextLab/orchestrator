# Issue #315 Analysis: API Interface

## Task Overview
Create clean user-facing API with pipeline compilation and execution methods. This task builds the primary interface layer that users will interact with to compile and execute their pipelines using the new architecture.

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ [#309] Core Architecture Foundation - COMPLETED
- ✅ [#310] YAML Pipeline Specification - COMPLETED
- ✅ [#311] Multi-Model Integration - COMPLETED  
- ✅ [#313] Execution Engine - COMPLETED
- **Ready to proceed**: All dependencies satisfied

## Parallel Work Stream Analysis

### Stream A: Core API Interface
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/api/core.py`, `src/orchestrator/api/__init__.py`
**Scope**: 
- Main API interface for pipeline operations (compile, execute, status)
- Clean, intuitive method signatures and documentation
- Integration with all completed components
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

### Stream B: Pipeline Operations
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/api/pipeline.py`, `src/orchestrator/api/execution.py`
**Scope**:
- Pipeline compilation methods with YAML specification integration
- Pipeline execution methods with status tracking and monitoring
- Integration with execution engine and progress tracking
**Dependencies**: Stream A basic structure (can start in parallel)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

### Stream C: Error Handling & Documentation
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/api/errors.py`, `src/orchestrator/api/types.py`
**Scope**:
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Type definitions and API documentation
- Status management and real-time progress reporting
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B interfaces (can start after basic structure)
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 days

## Parallel Execution Plan

### Wave 1 (Immediate Start)
- **Stream A**: Core API Interface
- **Stream B**: Pipeline Operations (basic structure)

### Wave 2 (After Stream A basic interfaces)
- **Stream C**: Error Handling & Documentation
- **Stream B**: Complete integration with core systems

## File Structure Plan
```
src/orchestrator/api/
├── __init__.py          # Module exports and main API
├── core.py              # Stream A: Core API interface
├── pipeline.py          # Stream B: Pipeline compilation methods
├── execution.py         # Stream B: Pipeline execution methods
├── errors.py            # Stream C: Error handling
└── types.py             # Stream C: Type definitions
```

## Integration Points
- **Foundation Components**: Uses `src/orchestrator/foundation/` interfaces
- **YAML Compiler**: Integrates with `src/orchestrator/compiler/` for pipeline compilation
- **Execution Engine**: Uses `src/orchestrator/execution/` for pipeline execution
- **Model Integration**: Leverages `src/orchestrator/models/` for AI service management
- **Tool Management**: Integrates with `src/orchestrator/tools/` for tool operations

## Success Criteria Mapping
- Stream A: Clean API interface, intuitive method signatures
- Stream B: Pipeline compilation and execution with status tracking
- Stream C: Comprehensive error handling, status management, documentation

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A must establish core API interfaces before Stream C can complete documentation
- Stream B can work independently on compilation/execution with defined interfaces
- All streams must coordinate on error handling patterns and status reporting
- API serves as integration layer for all previously completed components
- Comprehensive integration testing required across all streams

## Key Design Considerations
- **User Experience**: Simple, intuitive API that abstracts complex internal architecture
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages with recovery guidance
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time progress and execution status reporting
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with examples and usage patterns
- **Integration**: Seamless coordination with all completed infrastructure components

## Final Integration Component
This API interface represents the culmination of all previous work, providing users with a clean, unified interface to:
- Compile YAML pipelines using the enhanced compiler system
- Execute pipelines with the comprehensive execution engine
- Monitor progress with real-time tracking systems
- Manage errors with sophisticated recovery mechanisms
- Access all tool and model management capabilities

Success here enables the repository migration phase and completes the core refactor implementation.
