# Task 008: Create automated test suite for all 25 pipelines

## Metadata

- **Task ID**: 008
- **Epic**: pipeline-fixes
- **Name**: Create automated test suite
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: High
- **Size**: L (12 hours)
- **Created**: 2025-08-22T13:29:31Z
- **Dependencies**: Task 007
- **Can Run in Parallel**: No

## Description

Create a comprehensive automated test suite for all 25 example pipelines to ensure reliability and catch regressions. This task involves:

1. Analyzing all 25 example pipelines to understand their requirements
2. Creating test cases that use real API calls (no mocks)
3. Setting up test infrastructure for pipeline validation
4. Implementing tests that verify both functionality and output quality
5. Creating test data and fixtures where needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated test suite covers all 25 example pipelines
- [ ] Tests use real API calls and external resources (no mocks)
- [ ] Test suite can be run via a single command
- [ ] Tests validate both pipeline execution and output quality
- [ ] Test failures provide clear diagnostic information
- [ ] Tests include edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Test execution time is reasonable (under 30 minutes total)

## Files Affected

- New test files for each pipeline
- Test configuration and infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline configuration (if applicable)
- Test data and fixtures
- Documentation for running tests

## Implementation Notes

- Follow the project's testing methodology requiring real API calls
- Use actual external resources (APIs, models, databases) as specified
- Test with variety of small models for local model testing
- Include visual verification for figures and interfaces
- Consider API call costs but prioritize correctness verification
- Ensure tests mimic actual user experience closely

## Testing Requirements

- All tests must pass consistently
- Tests should validate output content quality
- Include tests for error handling and edge cases
- Verify that pipeline outputs match expected formats
- Test with different input variations where applicable
- Validate checkpoints and intermediate outputs

## Definition of Done

- Comprehensive test suite exists for all 25 pipelines
- All tests use real external resources as required
- Test suite passes consistently
- Documentation explains how to run tests
- Tests catch common pipeline issues and regressions
- Test results provide actionable feedback for failures
