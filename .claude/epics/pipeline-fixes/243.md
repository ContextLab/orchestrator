## Description

Fix all pipeline-specific issues identified in GitHub issues #158-#182 and validate each of the 25 pipelines works correctly. This task involves:

1. Analyzing and prioritizing issues from GitHub issues #158-#182
2. Implementing fixes for each identified issue
3. Validating all 25 example pipelines end-to-end
4. Ensuring pipeline outputs meet quality standards
5. Testing edge cases and error conditions for each pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All issues from GitHub #158-#182 are resolved
- [ ] Each of the 25 pipelines executes successfully
- [ ] Pipeline outputs are high quality (no unrendered text, missing content, etc.)
- [ ] No conversational content appears in outputs
- [ ] Hard-coded values are replaced with computed values where appropriate
- [ ] Error handling is robust across all pipelines
- [ ] Performance issues are addressed
- [ ] API key handling works correctly for all pipelines

## Files Affected

- All 25 example pipeline files
- Core pipeline infrastructure code
- Configuration files
- Documentation for affected pipelines
- Test files and validation scripts

## Implementation Notes

- Debug root causes rather than implementing workarounds
- Make modifications in place after committing backups
- Manually examine all outputs for quality issues
- Use real API calls and resources for validation
- Focus on production-quality fixes, not simplified solutions
- Ensure fixes don't introduce regressions in other pipelines

## Testing Requirements

- Validate each pipeline with real API calls and resources
- Test with various input scenarios
- Verify output quality manually
- Check checkpoints and intermediate files
- Ensure error conditions are handled gracefully
- Test performance under normal load conditions

## Definition of Done

- All GitHub issues #158-#182 are closed
- All 25 pipelines execute successfully from start to finish
- Pipeline outputs pass manual quality inspection
- No regressions introduced in previously working functionality
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- Performance meets acceptable standards
- Code changes are properly tested and documented
