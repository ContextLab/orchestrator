- **Name**: Remove debug output and implement logging
- **Status**: COMPLETED

## Description

Remove all debug print statements and implement proper logging throughout the codebase. This task involves:

1. Identifying all files with print statements or DEBUG output
2. Replacing print statements with appropriate logging calls
3. Ensuring consistent logging configuration across the project
4. Setting up proper log levels and formatting

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All print statements used for debugging are removed or replaced with logging
- [ ] Consistent logging configuration is implemented
- [ ] Log levels are appropriately set (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [ ] No debug output appears in production runs unless explicitly enabled
- [ ] Logging format is consistent across all modules

## Files Affected

- All Python files with print/DEBUG statements
- Logging configuration files
- Pipeline execution scripts

## Implementation Notes

- Use Python's standard `logging` module
- Consider implementing a centralized logging configuration
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Ensure logging doesn't impact performance significantly

## Testing Requirements

- Verify no unwanted output in production runs
- Test logging configuration works correctly
- Confirm log levels can be adjusted as needed
- Validate log formatting is consistent

## Definition of Done

- All debug print statements removed or converted to logging
- Logging configuration properly implemented
- Tests pass with new logging implementation
- Documentation updated if logging configuration changes
