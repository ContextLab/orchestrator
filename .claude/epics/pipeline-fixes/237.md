## Metadata

- **Name**: Fix generate-structured return format
- **Status**: TODO

## Description

Fix the generate-structured tool to return proper objects instead of strings. Currently, the tool may be returning string representations of structured data instead of the actual structured objects, which breaks downstream processing that expects to work with the structured data directly.

This affects the model_based_control_system.py and any other components that rely on structured output from text generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] generate-structured returns proper Python objects (dict, list, etc.)
- [ ] Return format is consistent with expected data structures
- [ ] Downstream processing works correctly with returned objects
- [ ] No string-to-object conversion needed in consuming code
- [ ] Error handling preserves structured format when possible

## Files Affected

- `model_based_control_system.py`
- generate-structured tool implementation
- Any pipeline steps that use generate-structured output
- Related test files

## Implementation Notes

- Identify where generate-structured is returning strings instead of objects
- Ensure proper parsing/deserialization of generated content
- Maintain backward compatibility if any code expects string format
- Consider JSON parsing, YAML parsing, or other structured data formats
- Handle edge cases where structured generation fails

## Testing Requirements

- Test generate-structured with various output formats
- Verify downstream processing works with object returns
- Test error cases and ensure graceful handling
- Validate that structured data maintains proper types (int, float, bool, etc.)
- Integration tests with model_based_control_system.py

## Definition of Done

- generate-structured returns proper objects, not strings
- All downstream processing works without additional conversion
- Tests pass with new return format
- Error handling maintains structured approach
- Documentation updated to reflect correct return types
