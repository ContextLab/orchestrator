# Issue #255 - Stream A Progress: File Discovery & Analysis

## Current Status: In Progress

### Task Overview
- **Stream**: File Discovery & Analysis  
- **Scope**: Automated repository scanning, file categorization system, safety checks
- **Goal**: Build foundation for safe file organization operations

### Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Analyzed current repository structure and identified major issues
- [x] Reviewed existing pipeline discovery mechanisms in src/orchestrator/tools/discovery.py
- [x] Examined current validation framework in scripts/validate_all_pipelines.py
- [x] Identified 40+ scattered files in root directory, 1000+ checkpoint files, and inconsistent directory structures

### In Progress Tasks ðŸ”„
- [ ] Create `scripts/repository_scanner.py` with comprehensive file categorization
- [ ] Build safety check framework with backup validation
- [ ] Generate detailed file inventory and categorization report

### Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Integrate with existing pipeline discovery mechanisms
- [ ] Create file pattern matching for different types (tests, data, logs, etc.)
- [ ] Build safety validation that prevents accidental deletion of important files
- [ ] Test scanning system on repository
- [ ] Generate comprehensive file inventory for other streams

### Key Findings
1. **Root Directory Issues**: 
   - 15+ test files (`test_*.py`, `test_*.yaml`)
   - 5+ validation/regeneration scripts (`verify_*.py`, `regenerate_*.py`)
   - Multiple data files (`processed_data.csv`, `data_processing_report.html`)
   - Log files (`validation_run.log`)

2. **Checkpoint Directory**: 
   - 1000+ files with inconsistent naming patterns
   - Debug checkpoints mixed with production ones
   - No automated cleanup mechanism

3. **Examples Output Issues**:
   - Inconsistent naming (underscore vs dash)
   - Timestamped files creating clutter
   - Malformed directory names

4. **Existing Infrastructure**:
   - Tool discovery system in `src/orchestrator/tools/discovery.py` available for extension
   - Validation framework in `scripts/validate_all_pipelines.py` can be integrated
   - Scripts directory already exists with good organization

### Implementation Plan
**Phase 1**: Create repository scanner with categorization engine
**Phase 2**: Build safety validation framework  
**Phase 3**: Generate comprehensive inventory reports
**Phase 4**: Integration testing and validation

### Notes
- Repository has significant organization issues that need systematic approach
- Existing tool discovery and validation infrastructure can be leveraged
- Safety-first approach is critical given 1000+ files to potentially move
