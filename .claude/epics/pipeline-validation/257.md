# Task: LLM Quality Review System

## Description
Implement AI-powered quality assessment using Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-5 with vision capabilities. Create systematic prompting for output quality review, integrate with existing credential management, and implement cost optimization through caching and incremental assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration with Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-5 APIs using existing credential management
- [ ] Vision-capable analysis for images, charts, and visual reports
- [ ] Systematic prompting framework for quality assessment criteria
- [ ] Quality checks for output location, file naming, unrendered elements
- [ ] Detection of poor quality responses, hallucinations, and incomplete content
- [ ] Smart caching system to minimize API costs (target < $50/month)
- [ ] Incremental review system for changed pipelines only

## Technical Details
- **Integration**: Use existing `.env` and GitHub secrets credential management
- **APIs**: Claude Sonnet 4 for text analysis, ChatGPT-5 with vision for visual content
- **Prompting**: Systematic prompts checking location, naming, rendering, quality, completeness
- **Caching**: Cache LLM responses based on content hashes to avoid re-analysis
- **Cost Control**: Budget monitoring, rate limiting, incremental analysis
- **Output Analysis**: Validate `examples/outputs/<pipeline name>/` structure and content

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Clean repository structure for consistent analysis
- [ ] LLM API access and credential configuration verification
- [ ] Systematic prompting framework design
- [ ] Cost optimization and caching strategy definition

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)  
- **Hours**: 24-28 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run with 002, 004 after 001)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] LLM quality review system implemented with both AI providers
- [ ] Vision analysis operational for visual pipeline outputs
- [ ] Cost optimization achieved (< $50/month for 40+ pipelines)
- [ ] Systematic quality assessment prompts validated
- [ ] Caching system reduces redundant API calls by >60%
- [ ] Integration with validation engine plugin architecture
