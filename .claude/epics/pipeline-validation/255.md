# Task: Repository Organization & Cleanup

## Description
Implement automated repository organization and cleanup system to address Issue #2 and create foundation for validation system. This includes consolidating scattered example files, removing temporary/debug files, standardizing directory structure, and establishing organized file management procedures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated file scanning and organization system implemented
- [ ] All temporary files and debugging scripts identified and removed/organized
- [ ] Standardized directory structure established for examples and outputs
- [ ] Scattered example files consolidated into consistent locations
- [ ] Repository hygiene monitoring and reporting system deployed
- [ ] Safety checks and backup procedures for cleanup operations
- [ ] Integration with existing pipeline discovery mechanisms

## Technical Details
- **Implementation**: `scripts/repository_organizer.py` as main orchestrator
- **File Discovery**: Extend existing pipeline discovery for comprehensive file scanning
- **Safety Measures**: Backup procedures before cleanup, rollback capabilities
- **Standards**: Define and enforce directory structure standards
- **Monitoring**: Automated detection of organization violations
- **Integration**: Hook into existing validation and discovery systems

## Dependencies
- [ ] Analysis of current repository structure and scattered files
- [ ] Definition of target organization standards
- [ ] Integration points with existing pipeline discovery
- [ ] Safety and backup procedure requirements

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: false (foundation for other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Repository organization system implemented and tested
- [ ] All identified temporary/debug files properly handled
- [ ] Directory structure standardized and enforced
- [ ] Automated monitoring and reporting operational
- [ ] Safety procedures validated through testing
- [ ] Documentation updated with new organization standards
- [ ] Integration with existing systems validated
