# Task: Two-Tier CI/CD Integration

## Description
Implement two-tier testing system with existing GitHub Actions infrastructure. Fast validation for routine development workflow (< 5 minutes) and comprehensive validation for releases with full pipeline execution and LLM review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fast validation tier: syntax checks, basic compilation (< 5 minutes)
- [ ] Comprehensive validation tier: full pipeline execution with LLM review
- [ ] Git hooks for pre-commit fast validation
- [ ] Pull request validation with appropriate tier selection
- [ ] Release validation triggers comprehensive testing automatically
- [ ] Manual trigger capability for comprehensive validation
- [ ] Integration with existing GitHub Actions and notification systems

## Technical Details
- **Fast Tier**: Syntax validation, template checking, basic compilation without execution
- **Comprehensive Tier**: Full pipeline execution, LLM review, visual validation, performance monitoring
- **GitHub Actions**: Extend existing workflows with tier-appropriate validation
- **Triggers**: Automatic tier selection based on context (PR vs release vs manual)
- **Notifications**: Integration with existing notification systems for results
- **Rollback**: Quality gates prevent deployment of failing comprehensive validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Repository organization for consistent CI/CD structure
- [ ] Task 002: Enhanced validation engine for fast and comprehensive modes
- [ ] Task 003: LLM quality review system for comprehensive validation
- [ ] Analysis of existing GitHub Actions and notification infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 22-26 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run with 005, 006)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Two-tier testing system implemented with clear tier separation
- [ ] Fast validation provides sub-5-minute feedback for development
- [ ] Comprehensive validation includes all quality assessment components
- [ ] Git hooks and GitHub Actions integration operational
- [ ] Manual and automatic triggers working correctly
- [ ] Quality gates prevent deployment of validation failures
