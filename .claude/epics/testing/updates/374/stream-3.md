# Stream 3: Phase 1 - Infrastructure Validation

## Scope
Critical blocker resolution and infrastructure validation for systematic test execution

## Files
- tests/test_infrastructure.py (add TestModel/TestProvider aliases)
- Pytest collection validation across 217 test files
- TestModel/TestProvider pattern verification

## Progress

### COMPLETED ✅
1. **Applied Critical Blocker Fix** (2025-09-04T14:08:00Z)
   - Added TestModel = MockTestModel alias to tests/test_infrastructure.py  
   - Added TestProvider = MockTestProvider alias to tests/test_infrastructure.py
   - Resolved 113 collection errors that were blocking test suite execution

2. **Validated Pytest Collection** (2025-09-04T14:10:00Z)
   - ✅ Successfully collected 4,207 test items from 217 test files
   - ✅ Zero collection errors - all test files now parseable
   - ✅ TestModel/TestProvider aliases working across entire test suite
   - ✅ Infrastructure patterns validated and functional

3. **Verified Functionality** (2025-09-04T14:12:00Z)
   - ✅ TestModel alias correctly resolves to MockTestModel
   - ✅ TestProvider alias correctly resolves to MockTestProvider  
   - ✅ create_test_orchestrator() creates functional Orchestrator instance
   - ✅ All 115+ test files now have access to required infrastructure

### PHASE 1 RESULTS ✅
- **Target Achieved**: 0 collection errors, all 217 test files parseable
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Validated and ready for systematic execution
- **Test Infrastructure**: TestModel/TestProvider patterns proven functional
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Systematic Execution Analysis can now proceed
