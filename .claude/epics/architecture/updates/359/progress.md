# Progress Tracking: Issue #359 - Epic Analysis and Planning

## Current Status
- **Started:** 2025-09-04T22:08:35Z  
- **Last Sync:** 2025-09-04T22:08:35Z
- **Completion:** 10%

## Work Completed
- [x] Issue details retrieved from GitHub
- [x] Local task file located (.claude/epics/architecture/359.md)
- [x] Analysis created with parallel stream identification
- [x] Epic worktree established (../epic-architecture)
- [x] Progress tracking initialized

## Parallel Streams Analysis
### Stream A: Epic Structure Documentation
- Status: Ready to launch
- Dependencies: None
- Can start immediately

### Stream B: Architecture Assessment  
- Status: Ready to launch
- Dependencies: None
- Can start immediately

### Stream C: Planning Framework Development
- Status: Waiting on Streams A & B
- Dependencies: Completion of A & B

## Next Steps
1. Launch Stream A agent (Epic Structure Documentation)
2. Launch Stream B agent (Architecture Assessment)
3. Monitor parallel execution
4. Launch Stream C when dependencies resolved
5. Assign GitHub issue and mark in-progress

## Technical Notes
- Worktree created successfully at ../epic-architecture
- Analysis file created at .claude/epics/architecture/359-analysis.md
- No blocking dependencies identified for initial parallel streams

## Blockers
None currently identified.

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk task primarily involving analysis and documentation
- Well-defined scope with clear deliverables
- Parallel execution plan reduces overall timeline
