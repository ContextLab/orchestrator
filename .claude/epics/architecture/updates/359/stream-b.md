**Agent:** code-analyzer  
**Started:** 2025-09-04T22:08:35Z  
**Status:** launching  
**Dependencies:** None

## Objective
Map current system architecture, identify improvement opportunities, and document technical debt areas.

## Tasks
1. Analyze core pipeline system structure
2. Document control systems architecture
3. Map task execution framework
4. Assess tool integration patterns
5. Evaluate quality systems (logging, validation)

## Key Components to Analyze
- src/orchestrator/core/ - Core pipeline system
- src/orchestrator/control_systems/ - Control and execution
- src/orchestrator/tools/ - Tool integration
- src/orchestrator/quality/ - Quality systems
- tests/ - Testing architecture patterns

## Deliverables
- System architecture map
- Component dependency diagram
- Technical debt assessment
- Improvement opportunities report
