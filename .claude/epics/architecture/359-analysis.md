# Issue #359 Analysis: Epic Analysis and Planning

## Context
This task is part of the Architecture & Core epic and involves analyzing epic requirements to create a detailed implementation plan.

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Epic Structure Analysis
Need to understand:
- Current epic organization in .claude/epics/
- Task breakdown methodology
- Dependency tracking systems
- Parallel vs sequential execution patterns

### 2. Architecture Assessment
Analyze current orchestrator architecture:
- Core pipeline system structure
- Control systems (hybrid_control_system.py)
- Task execution framework
- Tool integration patterns
- Quality systems (logging, validation)

### 3. Implementation Planning Framework
Create systematic approach for:
- Breaking down complex epics into manageable tasks
- Identifying technical dependencies
- Estimating effort and timeline
- Planning parallel execution streams
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## Parallel Streams Identified

### Stream A: Epic Structure Documentation
- Document current epic organization patterns
- Analyze task breakdown methodologies
- Create templates for future epic analysis
- Dependencies: None (can start immediately)

### Stream B: Architecture Assessment
- Map current system architecture
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Document technical debt areas
- Dependencies: None (can start immediately)  

### Stream C: Planning Framework Development
- Create systematic planning methodology
- Develop estimation frameworks
- Build dependency analysis tools
- Dependencies: Streams A & B completion

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Immediate Start (Parallel Streams A & B)
Both streams can begin immediately as they involve analysis of existing systems without dependencies.

### Phase 2: Framework Development (Stream C)
Synthesize findings from phases A & B to create comprehensive planning framework.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Epic structure thoroughly documented
- [ ] Architecture comprehensively mapped
- [ ] Planning framework developed and validated
- [ ] Implementation approach clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies and risks identified
- [ ] Timeline and effort estimates provided

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Primarily analysis and documentation
- Main challenge: Ensuring comprehensive coverage
- Mitigation: Systematic approach with multiple validation points

## Resource Requirements
- 3 parallel analysis agents initially
- 1 synthesis agent for framework development
- Estimated 8-16 hours total effort
- No external dependencies or API costs

## Next Steps
1. Launch Stream A and B agents immediately
2. Monitor progress and coordinate findings
3. Launch Stream C when dependencies met
4. Synthesize final implementation plan
