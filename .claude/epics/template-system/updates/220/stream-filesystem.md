# Stream 2: Filesystem Tool Fix (#220)

**Issue**: Filesystem tool not resolving template variables in paths and content
**Status**: In Progress

## Analysis

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ FileSystemTool exists in `/src/orchestrator/tools/system_tools.py`
- ✅ Has basic template resolution logic in place
- ❌ Template resolution not working properly - files created with literal template syntax

### Key Problems Identified
1. Path template resolution happening but may not be working correctly
2. Content template resolution has fallback logic but may not have proper context
3. Template manager/resolver not being passed correctly from execution context

### Investigation Progress

#### Phase 1: Code Analysis ✅
- [x] Located filesystem tool implementation
- [x] Analyzed current template resolution logic
- [x] Identified potential issues with context passing

#### Phase 2: Test Case Analysis (In Progress)
- [ ] Examine failing pipeline examples
- [ ] Identify exact template variables not being resolved
- [ ] Test current resolution logic

#### Phase 3: Fix Implementation (Pending)
- [ ] Fix path template resolution
- [ ] Fix content template resolution  
- [ ] Ensure proper context passing
- [ ] Add debugging/logging

#### Phase 4: Testing (Pending)
- [ ] Create test pipeline
- [ ] Verify fixes work
- [ ] Test edge cases

## Next Steps
1. Examine actual failing pipeline to understand exact issue
2. Test current template resolution logic
3. Implement fixes for identified problems
