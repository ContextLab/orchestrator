# Stream 3: Control Flow Variables (Issue #219)

## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Issue Description
While loop variables like `$iteration` are not available in templates within loop steps, causing template syntax errors and preventing loops from functioning properly.

## Problem Analysis
1. **Root Cause**: While loop handler correctly sets `$iteration` in `loop_variables` metadata, but there's a mismatch between:
   - `LoopContextVariables` class designed for for-each loops (provides `$index` for item indexing)
   - While loops need `$iteration` for iteration counting (different concept)

2. **Current Behavior**: 
   - While loop handler manually creates `loop_variables` with `$iteration`
   - Template manager receives these variables correctly
   - But filesystem tool preprocesses `{{ $iteration }}` to `{{ iteration }}`
   - Template manager should have both `$iteration` and `iteration` but rendering fails

3. **Test Evidence**:
   ```
   Undefined variable 'iteration' rendered as placeholder: {{iteration}}
   Files created as: iteration_None.txt (should be iteration_0.txt, etc.)
   ```

## Investigation Findings
- While loop handler correctly creates loop context and enhanced context
- Task metadata includes correct `loop_variables`: `{"$iteration": iteration, "iteration": iteration, ...}`
- Hybrid control system correctly registers loop variables with template manager
- Issue appears to be in template rendering chain

## Current Work
- [x] Analyze current while loop variable handling
- [x] Identify disconnect between loop context and template rendering
- [ ] Fix the while loop variable injection
- [ ] Test the fix with filesystem tool
- [ ] Verify for-each loops still work
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests

## Next Steps
1. Fix the while loop context to properly provide `$iteration`
2. Ensure template variables are correctly passed to template manager
3. Test with the failing test case
4. Verify no regression in for-each loops
