# Task: Control Flow Routing System

## Description
Implement advanced control flow routing system in YAML pipeline definitions with StateGraph integration. This system enables conditional execution paths using condition expressions, on_false handlers, on_failure error handling, and on_success continuation logic, providing sophisticated pipeline branching capabilities for complex workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement condition evaluation system for YAML pipeline steps with Python expressions
- [ ] Implement on_false routing for condition failures
- [ ] Implement on_failure error handling and routing for step failures
- [ ] Implement on_success continuation routing for successful completions
- [ ] Integration with StateGraph for execution flow management and conditional edges
- [ ] Support for complex conditional expressions with pipeline variable access
- [ ] Proper error propagation and handling in routing decisions
- [ ] Compilation validation to prevent circular dependencies and invalid routing targets

## Technical Details
- **YAML Enhancement**: Extend YAML compiler in src/orchestrator/compiler/yaml_compiler.py
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement Python expression evaluation with pipeline variable access
- **StateGraph Integration**: Create conditional edge logic for dynamic routing
- **Routing Framework**: Add routing decision framework integrated with execution engine
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Validation**: Ensure proper state transitions and prevent circular dependencies

## Dependencies
- Real execution engine (Task 001) for actual condition evaluation with real data
- YAML compiler system for parsing routing attributes
- StateGraph execution framework for conditional edges
- Pipeline execution engine for routing decisions

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other tasks after Task 001)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full control flow routing capabilities
- [ ] Tests written and passing with real conditional execution scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with routing syntax and examples
- [ ] Code reviewed for production readiness
- [ ] Integration validated with existing pipeline definitions
