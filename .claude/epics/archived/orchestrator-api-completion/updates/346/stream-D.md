## Implementation Summary

### Core Components Created

1. **ExecutionModelSelector** (`src/orchestrator/execution/model_selector.py`)
   - Unified model selection module coordinating all selection logic
   - Runtime model context analysis and intelligent selection
   - Adaptive selection learning from execution history
   - Expert assignment integration with tool-model mappings
   - Cost optimization and performance-aware selection strategies
   - Selection quality evaluation and performance metrics

2. **Enhanced StateGraphEngine** (`src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py`)
   - Integrated ExecutionModelSelector for runtime model selection
   - Enhanced `_execute_single_step` with intelligent model selection
   - Added model selection recommendations API
   - Implemented model-specific execution simulation
   - Added budget utilization tracking for cost-aware selection

3. **Enhanced PipelineExecutor** (`src/orchestrator/api/execution.py`)
   - Added `execute_with_intelligent_selection` method
   - Integrated model selection recommendations API
   - Added execution efficiency analysis capabilities
   - Enhanced metrics with model selection quality tracking
   - Created convenience factory functions for intelligent execution

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`tests/execution/test_model_selection.py`)
   - 20+ test methods covering all aspects of model selection integration
   - Mock model registry and execution context setup
   - Testing of selection strategies (cost, performance, accuracy optimized)
   - Expert assignment priority verification
   - Adaptive selection learning validation
   - End-to-end integration testing

### Key Features Implemented

#### Runtime Model Selection
- **Context-aware selection**: Models chosen based on step requirements, execution state, and available variables
- **Strategy-driven selection**: Support for balanced, cost-optimized, performance-optimized, and accuracy-optimized strategies
- **Expert assignment priority**: Tool-specific model assignments take precedence over algorithmic selection
- **AUTO tag resolution**: Dynamic model selection based on natural language descriptions

#### Adaptive Intelligence
- **Execution history tracking**: Learn from previous selections to improve future choices
- **Performance-based adaptation**: Adjust selection criteria based on historical success rates
- **Cost efficiency optimization**: Balance cost vs performance based on budget constraints
- **Quality feedback loop**: Evaluate selection quality and adapt strategies accordingly

#### Integration Features
- **Seamless backward compatibility**: Existing pipelines continue to work without modification
- **Progressive enhancement**: Intelligent selection only activates when model registry is available
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: Track model selection quality, cost efficiency, and performance metrics
- **Rich recommendations**: Provide upfront analysis of optimal model choices for planning

### Architecture Highlights

The implementation follows the established patterns and integrates smoothly with:
- **Stream A**: Uses ModelSelector and ModelSelectionCriteria for selection algorithms
- **Stream B**: Integrates expert assignments through RuntimeModelContext
- **Foundation layer**: Compatible with PipelineSpecification and execution interfaces
- **Existing execution engine**: Enhances without breaking existing functionality

### Testing Coverage

- **Unit tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration tests**: Component interaction and data flow
- **Mock-based testing**: Isolated testing with controlled dependencies
- **End-to-end scenarios**: Complete workflow validation
- **Error handling**: Failure modes and fallback behavior
- **Performance testing**: Selection quality and efficiency validation

## Commits
- `4f90606`: Issue #346: Stream D - Integrated model selection into pipeline execution

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

Stream D has successfully integrated the model selection intelligence from Streams A and B into a cohesive runtime system that intelligently selects optimal models during pipeline execution. The implementation provides:

2. **Runtime optimization**: Models selected dynamically based on real-time context
3. **Adaptive learning**: System improves selections based on execution history
4. **Expert integration**: Tool-specific assignments work seamlessly with algorithmic selection
5. **Comprehensive monitoring**: Full visibility into selection quality and efficiency
6. **Production ready**: Robust error handling, fallbacks, and backward compatibility

All acceptance criteria for Issue #346 Stream D have been met with comprehensive testing and documentation.
