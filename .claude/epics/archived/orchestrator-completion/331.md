# Testing & Documentation

## Overview
Create comprehensive test suite with real API calls and complete documentation for production deployment of the orchestrator system.

## Core Focus
- 100% test coverage with real APIs (absolutely no mocks)
- Comprehensive documentation and deployment guides
- Production-ready examples and use cases
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring setup

## Technical Implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Test Coverage
- [ ] 100% code coverage across all modules
- [ ] All tests use real APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete user workflows
- [ ] Performance tests establish baseline metrics
- [ ] Error scenario tests validate recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Deployment tests validate production configurations

### Real API Testing
- [ ] Anthropic Claude API integration fully tested
- [ ] OpenAI API integration fully tested
- [ ] Ollama local model integration tested
- [ ] Tool execution with real external services tested
- [ ] Rate limiting and error handling with real APIs tested
- [ ] API cost tracking and monitoring tested

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] Getting started guide allows new user success in <30 minutes
- [ ] API reference covers all endpoints with examples
- [ ] Deployment guide enables production deployment
- [ ] Architecture documentation explains all design decisions
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers common issues and solutions
- [ ] All examples are tested and working

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Docker deployment configuration validated
- [ ] Environment variable configuration documented
- [ ] Monitoring and logging setup documented
- [ ] Security considerations documented and implemented
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Performance tuning guidelines provided

### Example Applications
- [ ] Simple orchestrator example demonstrates basic usage
- [ ] Multi-model pipeline shows advanced features
- [ ] Tool integration example shows extensibility
- [ ] Production deployment example is fully functional
- [ ] All examples include comprehensive documentation

## Definition of Done
- Complete test suite with 100% coverage using real APIs
- Comprehensive documentation enables independent deployment
- Production-ready examples demonstrate all major features
- Performance benchmarks establish operational baselines
- Security review completed with recommendations implemented
- Deployment automation tested and documented

## Dependencies
Requires completion of all previous tasks (324-330) as this provides comprehensive testing and documentation of the complete system.

## Risk Mitigation
- Use test API keys with spending limits for real API testing
- Implement test isolation to prevent state contamination
- Create comprehensive test data cleanup procedures
- Document all external dependencies and version requirements
- Establish CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Success Metrics
- Test suite runs in <10 minutes with all real APIs
- Documentation enables successful deployment by new team
- Examples demonstrate 90% of common use cases
- Performance tests establish SLA baselines
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities identified
