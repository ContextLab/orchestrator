# Real Step Execution Engine

## Overview

Replace placeholder logic with actual tool/model execution in the StateGraph engine. This is the critical foundation task that transforms the orchestrator from architectural simulation to functional reality by implementing real execution in the `StateGraphEngine._execute_step()` method.

## Technical Scope

**Core Focus**: Modify `StateGraphEngine._execute_step()` for real tool registry calls and model provider API integration

**Primary Files**:
- `src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py` - Main execution engine enhancement
- `src/orchestrator/models/provider.py` - Model provider API integration
- `src/orchestrator/execution/context.py` - Execution context updates

**Architecture**: Build on existing StateGraph foundation without disrupting API contracts

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture Strengths
- Sophisticated StateGraph implementation using LangGraph
- Comprehensive execution state management (`ExecutionState` TypedDict)
- Well-designed error recovery and checkpoint infrastructure
- Robust progress tracking and quality control integration
- Clean separation between state management and execution logic

### Placeholder Logic Locations
```python
# src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py:_execute_step()
async def _execute_step(self, state: ExecutionState) -> ExecutionState:
    """Currently returns simulated results"""
    # TODO: Replace with real tool/model execution
    return self._simulate_step_execution(state)
```

### Integration Points Required
1. **Tool Registry Interface**: Connect to existing enhanced registry system
2. **Model Provider APIs**: Integrate real API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI
3. **Variable Management**: Connect execution results to `VariableManager`
4. **State Persistence**: Leverage existing `ExecutionContext` for result storage
5. **Error Handling**: Utilize existing recovery infrastructure for real failures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Real Execution (Days 1-3)
**Goal**: Replace core placeholder logic with functional execution

#### 1.1 Tool Registry Integration
```python
# Add real execution interface to StateGraphEngine
async def _execute_tool_step(self, step: PipelineStep, context: ExecutionState) -> StepResult:
    """Execute step using real tool registry"""
    tool_registry = self.foundation_config.get_tool_registry()
    tool = await tool_registry.get_tool(step.tool_name)
    
    # Prepare parameters from state variables
    parameters = self._resolve_step_parameters(step, context)
    
    # Execute real tool
    result = await tool.execute(**parameters)
    
    # Process result into StandardStepResult format
    return self._process_tool_result(result, step)
```

#### 1.2 Model Provider Integration
```python
# Add model execution to StateGraphEngine
async def _execute_model_step(self, step: PipelineStep, context: ExecutionState) -> StepResult:
    """Execute step using real model providers"""
    model_manager = self.foundation_config.get_model_manager()
    provider = await model_manager.get_provider(step.model_config.provider)
    
    # Prepare prompt and parameters from context
    prompt = self._resolve_step_prompt(step, context)
    model_params = self._resolve_model_parameters(step, context)
    
    # Execute real model call
    response = await provider.generate(prompt, **model_params)
    
    # Process response into StandardStepResult format
    return self._process_model_result(response, step)
```

#### 1.3 State Integration
```python
# Connect results to variable management
async def _process_step_result(self, result: StepResult, step: PipelineStep, 
                              context: ExecutionState) -> ExecutionState:
    """Process real execution result into state"""
    # Update variable manager with real results
    variable_manager = context['variable_manager']
    await variable_manager.set_variable(step.output_variable, result.output)
    
    # Update execution metadata
    context['execution_metadata']['steps_completed'] += 1
    context['execution_metadata']['last_step_result'] = result
    
    return context
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Execution Features (Days 4-6)
**Goal**: Add sophisticated execution capabilities

#### 2.1 Parameter Resolution Enhancement
- Dynamic parameter resolution from state variables
- Template expansion for complex parameter structures
- Type validation and coercion for tool parameters
- Context variable injection (loop variables, step outputs)

#### 2.2 Concurrent Execution Support
- Parallel step execution where dependencies allow
- Resource management for concurrent model calls
- State synchronization for parallel operations
- Deadlock prevention and resource contention handling

#### 2.3 Progress Tracking Integration
- Real-time step execution progress reporting
- Execution time measurement and performance metrics
- Resource usage tracking (API calls, tokens, compute time)
- Integration with existing `ProgressTracker` system

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Days 7-8)
**Goal**: Ensure robust production deployment

#### 3.1 Comprehensive Error Handling
```python
# Real execution error scenarios
try:
    result = await tool.execute(**parameters)
except ToolExecutionError as e:
    # Handle tool-specific failures
    return self._handle_tool_error(e, step, context)
except ModelProviderError as e:
    # Handle model API failures  
    return self._handle_model_error(e, step, context)
except ResourceExhaustionError as e:
    # Handle rate limits and quotas
    return await self._handle_resource_exhaustion(e, step, context)
```

#### 3.2 Resource Management
- Connection pooling for model provider APIs
- Request batching and rate limiting compliance
- Memory management for large execution states
- Cleanup procedures for failed executions

#### 3.3 Monitoring and Observability
- Execution metrics collection and reporting
- Debug logging for troubleshooting real execution issues
- Performance benchmarking against simulation baseline
- Health checks for external service dependencies

        if step.type == "tool":
            result = await self._execute_tool_step(step, state)
        elif step.type == "model": 
            result = await self._execute_model_step(step, state)
        elif step.type == "control":
            result = await self._execute_control_step(step, state)
