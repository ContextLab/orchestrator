# Model Integration & Intelligence

## Overview

Add orchestrator model integration for pipeline intention/architecture generation during compilation. This task integrates orchestrator model calls to generate pipeline summaries, architectural validation, and intelligent pipeline optimization suggestions, transforming the orchestrator from a static YAML executor into an intelligent pipeline orchestration platform with AI-driven insights.

## Technical Scope

**Core Focus**: Integrate orchestrator model calls during compilation, generate pipeline summaries and validation

**Primary Files**:
- `src/orchestrator/models/orchestrator.py` - New orchestrator model integration
- `src/orchestrator/api/core.py` - YAMLCompiler intelligence integration
- `src/orchestrator/models/provider.py` - Provider extension for orchestrator models
- `src/orchestrator/intelligence/` - New intelligence generation system

**Architecture**: Add intelligence layer to existing compilation pipeline without disrupting core functionality

## Intelligence Features Implementation

### 1. Pipeline Intention Analysis
```python
class PipelineIntelligence:
    """AI-powered pipeline analysis and optimization"""
    
    async def analyze_pipeline_intention(self, pipeline_spec: Dict[str, Any]) -> PipelineAnalysis:
        """
        Analyze pipeline YAML to understand:
        - Overall pipeline intention and purpose
        - Data flow patterns and dependencies
        - Potential optimization opportunities
        - Architecture quality assessment
        """
        
    async def generate_pipeline_summary(self, pipeline_spec: Dict[str, Any]) -> PipelineSummary:
        """Generate human-readable pipeline summary with architecture insights"""
```

### 2. Architecture Validation
```python
class ArchitectureValidator:
    """Validates pipeline architecture and suggests improvements"""
    
    async def validate_pipeline_architecture(self, pipeline: Pipeline) -> ValidationResult:
        """
        Validate pipeline architecture for:
        - Step dependency consistency
        - Variable flow correctness
        - Model selection appropriateness
        - Performance optimization opportunities
        """
        
    async def suggest_optimizations(self, pipeline: Pipeline) -> List[OptimizationSuggestion]:
        """Generate actionable optimization suggestions"""
```

### 3. Intelligent Model Selection
```python
class IntelligentModelSelector:
    """AI-powered model selection based on pipeline context"""
    
    async def recommend_models(self, step: StepDefinition, 
                             pipeline_context: PipelineContext) -> List[ModelRecommendation]:
        """
        Recommend optimal models based on:
        - Step complexity and requirements
        - Cost/performance constraints
        - Pipeline context and data types
        - Previous step outputs and patterns
        """
```

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Model Infrastructure Strengths
- Well-architected provider abstractions (`ModelProvider`, `ProviderConfig`)
- Comprehensive model registry with metadata
- Clean async model execution interface
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

### Intelligence Integration Opportunities
1. **Compilation Phase**: Add intelligence generation during YAML compilation
2. **Model Selection**: Enhance AUTO tag resolution with AI recommendations
3. **Validation**: Add architectural validation before execution
4. **Optimization**: Generate performance improvement suggestions
5. **Documentation**: Auto-generate pipeline documentation and explanations

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement configurable intelligence features to control costs
- Use model confidence scores to qualify recommendations

- Break large pipelines into smaller chunks for analysis
- Cache intelligence results to avoid repeated API calls
