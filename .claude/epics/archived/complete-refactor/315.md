# Task: API Interface

## Overview
Create clean user-facing API with pipeline compilation and execution methods. This task builds the primary interface layer that users will interact with to compile and execute their pipelines using the new architecture.

## Objectives
- Design and implement user-facing API interface
- Provide pipeline compilation methods with clear error handling
- Implement pipeline execution methods with status tracking
- Create intuitive method signatures and documentation
- Ensure seamless integration with core architecture components

## Dependencies
- 001: Core Architecture Foundation (needs basic execution engine and interfaces)
- 002: YAML Pipeline Specification (needs pipeline parsing capabilities)
- 003: Model Integration Architecture (needs model management system)
- 005: Execution Engine Implementation (needs complete execution runtime)

## Parallel Processing
- Cannot be parallelized with dependencies
- Must wait for completion of core architecture, YAML spec, models, and execution engine
- Final integration component before system migration

## Estimated Size
Medium (3-4 days)

## Key Components
1. **Pipeline API**: Main interface for pipeline operations (compile, execute, status)
2. **Compilation Interface**: Methods for transforming YAML to executable pipeline
3. **Execution Interface**: Methods for running pipelines with monitoring and control
4. **Status Management**: Real-time pipeline status and progress tracking
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery mechanisms

## Success Criteria
- Clean, intuitive API interface is implemented
- Pipeline compilation works seamlessly with YAML specifications
- Pipeline execution integrates properly with the execution engine
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting
- API documentation is complete and accurate
- All integration tests pass with real API calls

## Notes
This task represents the final integration layer that brings together all core components into a cohesive user experience. Success here enables the repository migration phase.
