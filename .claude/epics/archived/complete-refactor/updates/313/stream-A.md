## Stream A: Core StateGraph Engine

### Scope
- Files to modify: src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py, src/orchestrator/execution/__init__.py
- Work to complete: StateGraph runner implementation, workflow orchestration core, basic execution flow control

### Completed
- Created progress tracking file
- Analyzed foundation architecture and interfaces
- Implemented StateGraphEngine class with ExecutionEngineInterface
- Created LangGraph StateGraph-based workflow orchestration
- Added ExecutionState schema for comprehensive state management
- Implemented step execution with dependency handling and parallel execution
- Added basic progress tracking with timing and status information
- Designed coordination interfaces for Stream B (variables/state) and Stream C (progress/recovery)
- Included retry logic and condition evaluation capabilities
- Added comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Updated execution package exports
- Committed all changes with proper git messages

### Working On
- Stream A work complete, ready for coordination with other streams

### Stream A Implementation Summary

**Core StateGraphEngine Features:**
- Implements ExecutionEngineInterface from foundation architecture
- Uses LangGraph StateGraphs for robust workflow orchestration
- Comprehensive ExecutionState schema for state management across execution
- Dependency-based step execution with automatic parallelization
- Built-in progress tracking with timing, status, and completion metrics
- Error handling with retry logic and graceful failure management
- Condition evaluation for conditional step execution
- Memory-efficient state management with cleanup

**Coordination Interfaces Designed:**
- `set_variable_manager()` method for Stream B integration
- `set_progress_tracker()` method for Stream C integration
- ExecutionState schema provides hooks for variable and progress management
- ExecutionContext dataclass enables rich context passing between streams

**Key Implementation Details:**
- LangGraph StateGraph compilation from PipelineSpecification
- Topological sorting for optimal execution order
- Concurrent execution support with configurable worker limits
- Checkpoint and persistence support when LangGraph memory is available
- Comprehensive logging and error propagation
- Resource cleanup and memory management

### Files Modified
- `src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py` - Core StateGraphEngine implementation (639 lines)
- `src/orchestrator/execution/__init__.py` - Package exports updated

### Git Commits
- e4e219f: Core StateGraph execution engine implementation
- f0f6bf0: Export StateGraphEngine components from execution package

### Ready for Stream Coordination
Stream A provides the foundation execution engine that other streams can build upon:
- Stream B can integrate variable and state management via the provided hooks
- Stream C can integrate progress tracking and recovery mechanisms
- All streams can use the ExecutionState schema for consistent state sharing
