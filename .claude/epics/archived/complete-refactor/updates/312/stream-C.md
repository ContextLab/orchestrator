# Stream C: Dependency & Resource Management

## Scope
- Dependency handling system to ensure all required resources are available
- Resource management for efficient tool lifecycle management
- Dependency resolution algorithms

## Files
- `src/orchestrator/tools/dependencies.py`
- `src/orchestrator/tools/resources.py`

## Progress

### Completed âœ…
1. **Dependencies System (`src/orchestrator/tools/dependencies.py`)**
   - Implemented comprehensive dependency resolution with graph traversal algorithms
   - Added dependency chain validation and circular dependency detection  
   - Integrated conflict detection with severity levels (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO)
   - Created DependencyResolver class with topological sorting for installation order
   - Added DependencyManager for high-level dependency operations
   - Implemented caching for performance optimization

2. **Resource Management System (`src/orchestrator/tools/resources.py`)**
   - Built comprehensive resource lifecycle management system
   - Implemented ResourceManager with allocation, monitoring, and cleanup
   - Added ResourcePool for resource sharing and reuse
   - Created ResourceMonitor for real-time resource tracking
   - Integrated memory, CPU, and process monitoring with psutil
   - Added automatic cleanup and garbage collection systems

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Full integration with EnhancedToolRegistry from Stream A
   - Leveraged tool relationships (provides/requires/conflicts) for dependency resolution
   - Integration with SetupSystem from Stream B for automatic installation
   - Used installation callbacks and status tracking from Stream B

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Complete test suite for dependency resolution algorithms
   - Resource management integration tests
   - Mock-based unit tests for all major components
   - Conflict detection and resolution testing
   - Resource lifecycle and cleanup testing

### Key Features Implemented

#### Dependency Resolution
- Graph-based dependency traversal with cycle detection
- Topological sorting for optimal installation order  
- Multi-level conflict detection (explicit conflicts, version conflicts, compatibility)
- Support for different dependency types (REQUIRED, OPTIONAL, RUNTIME, etc.)
- Comprehensive caching system for performance

#### Resource Management  
- Resource allocation with configurable limits (memory, CPU, time, access count)
- Resource pools for efficient sharing and reuse
- Real-time monitoring with automatic limit enforcement
- Context manager support for automatic cleanup
- Support for various resource types (memory, files, connections, processes)

#### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with tool registry for dependency metadata
- Automatic installation coordination with setup system
- Performance metrics integration with registry performance tracking
- Security policy enforcement during resource allocation

### Architecture Highlights
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Async/await support throughout for non-blocking operations  
- Thread-safe resource pools and monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Extensive logging and debugging support
