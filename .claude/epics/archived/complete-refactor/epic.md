# Epic: Complete Orchestrator Refactor

## Overview

Complete architectural overhaul of the orchestrator toolbox to address fundamental design misalignment and create a streamlined, robust system centered around YAML-defined pipeline execution with LangGraph integration. This epic implements the comprehensive specification detailed in GitHub Issue #307, transforming the orchestrator into a clean, maintainable AI pipeline orchestration platform.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Pipeline Engine**: LangGraph StateGraph for execution flow management
- **Configuration Format**: YAML-based pipeline definitions with comprehensive validation
- **Multi-Model Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, HuggingFace, and Ollama integration
- **Orchestration**: LLM-driven pipeline coordination and quality control
- **Platform Support**: Multi-platform compatibility (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows) on Python 3.9+

### Key Design Principles
- **In-Place Development**: Complete component replacement without backup files or redundancy
- **Repository Cleanliness**: 100% clean repository with continuous validation throughout development
- **Progressive Enhancement**: User experience with progress bars for long operations (model downloads)
- **Comprehensive Validation**: 100% test coverage with real API calls, no mocks

### API Design Philosophy
```python
import orchestrator as orc

# Simple, intuitive compilation
pipeline = orc.compile("research_report.yaml")

# Rich metadata access
print(pipeline.intention)     # LLM-generated summary
print(pipeline.architecture)  # LLM-generated architecture description

# Flexible execution
result = pipeline.run(topic="AI safety", style="academic")

# Comprehensive results
result.outputs  # Dictionary of step outputs
result.qc()     # Automated quality control report
orc.log.markdown(result.log)  # Human-readable execution log
```

## Technical Approach

### Pipeline Compilation System
- **YAML Parser**: Convert YAML definitions to internal StateGraph representation
- **Dependency Analyzer**: Automatic parallelization and sequential execution planning
- **Model Resolver**: Intelligent model selection based on requirements and preferences
- **Tool Manager**: Automatic tool initialization, setup, and validation
- **Validation Engine**: Comprehensive compilation-time error detection and reporting

### Execution Engine
- **LangGraph Integration**: Native StateGraph execution with proper state management
- **Variable Management**: Thread-safe variable state with structured outputs via LangChain
- **Step Orchestration**: LLM-driven step coordination with error handling and routing
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking with user feedback
- **Quality Control**: Automated output assessment and improvement recommendations

### Model Management Infrastructure
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Unified interface for all major AI providers
- **Intelligent Selection**: Cost, performance, or balanced model selection strategies
- **Expert Assignment**: Specialized model assignment based on tool requirements
- **Resource Management**: Efficient model loading/unloading with progress indication
- **Credential Handling**: Secure API key management via ~/.orchestrator/.env

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Philosophy
- **Complete Replacement**: Large components will be completely scrapped or rewritten
- **No Redundancy**: No backup functions, parallel implementations, or temporary compatibility layers
- **Clean Transitions**: Each component replaced entirely before moving to next
- **Continuous Validation**: Automated repository cleanliness checks throughout development
- **Real-World Testing**: All functionality tested with actual API calls and resources

### Quality Assurance
- **Test-Driven Development**: 100% unit test coverage requirement
- **Real API Testing**: All user-facing functions tested with actual model providers
- **Manual Verification**: Human review required for all critical functionality
- **Documentation-Driven**: Complete API documentation during development
- **Multi-Platform Validation**: Testing across macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows
