# Issue #313 Analysis: Execution Engine

## Task Overview
Implement the core StateGraph runner with comprehensive variable management and progress tracking capabilities to handle pipeline execution workflows.

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ [#309] Core Architecture Foundation - COMPLETED
- ✅ [#310] YAML Pipeline Specification - COMPLETED
- **Ready to proceed**: All dependencies satisfied

## Parallel Work Stream Analysis

### Stream A: Core StateGraph Engine
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py`, `src/orchestrator/execution/__init__.py`
**Scope**: 
- StateGraph runner implementation
- Workflow orchestration core
- Basic execution flow control
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

### Stream B: Variable & State Management
**Agent**: `general-purpose`  
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/execution/state.py`, `src/orchestrator/execution/variables.py`
**Scope**:
- Variable management system for data flow
- State persistence and context management
- Execution context isolation
**Dependencies**: Stream A foundation (can start in parallel)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

### Stream C: Progress & Recovery Systems
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Files**: `src/orchestrator/execution/progress.py`, `src/orchestrator/execution/recovery.py`
**Scope**:
- Real-time progress tracking
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Checkpoint and resume functionality
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B interfaces (can start after basic structure)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

## Parallel Execution Plan

### Wave 1 (Immediate Start)
- **Stream A**: Core StateGraph Engine
- **Stream B**: Variable & State Management

### Wave 2 (After Stream A basic structure)
- **Stream C**: Progress & Recovery Systems

## File Structure Plan
```
src/orchestrator/execution/
├── __init__.py          # Module exports
├── engine.py           # Stream A: Core StateGraph runner
├── state.py            # Stream B: State management 
├── variables.py        # Stream B: Variable management
├── progress.py         # Stream C: Progress tracking
└── recovery.py         # Stream C: Error handling & recovery
```

## Integration Points
- **Foundation Interface**: Uses `src/orchestrator/foundation/` components
- **YAML Compiler**: Integrates with `src/orchestrator/compiler/` outputs
- **StateGraph**: Native LangGraph StateGraph execution
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with real-world validation

## Success Criteria Mapping
- Stream A: StateGraph execution, basic workflow orchestration
- Stream B: Variable management, execution context isolation
- Stream C: Progress tracking, error handling, checkpoint/resume

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A must establish core interfaces before Stream C can fully integrate
- Stream B can work independently with defined interfaces
- All streams must coordinate on shared state management patterns
- Regular integration testing required as streams converge
