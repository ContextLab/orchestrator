# Task: Multi-Model Integration

## Overview
Build unified model management system with provider abstractions and intelligent selection strategies. This task creates a robust foundation for working with multiple AI models from different providers within the orchestrator framework.

## Objectives
- Implement unified model management system
- Create provider abstractions for different AI services
- Build intelligent model selection strategies
- Establish consistent interfaces for model interactions

## Dependencies
- [001] Core Architecture Foundation (requires architectural interfaces)

## Parallel Processing
- Can work in parallel with YAML Pipeline Specification (task 002)
- Both depend on core architecture but can be developed simultaneously

## Estimated Size
Large (5-7 days)

## Key Components
1. **Model Manager**: Central system for managing available models
2. **Provider Abstractions**: Unified interfaces for different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)
3. **Selection Strategies**: Logic for automatically choosing appropriate models based on task requirements
4. **Model Registry**: Configuration and discovery system for available models
5. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, connection pooling, and efficient model utilization

## Success Criteria
- Multiple AI providers are supported through unified interfaces
- Model selection strategies work correctly for different pipeline requirements
- Model registry allows easy configuration and discovery
- Performance optimizations reduce latency and resource usage
- All model integration tests pass with real providers

## Notes
This task can be developed in parallel with the YAML specification work since both depend on the core architecture but don't directly conflict. The model management system will integrate with the pipeline execution engine established in task 001.
