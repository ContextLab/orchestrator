# Task: Repository Migration

## Overview
Replace existing components in-place while maintaining continuous functionality. This critical task performs the actual migration from the old architecture to the new refactored system, ensuring zero downtime and backward compatibility during the transition.

## Objectives
- Replace existing pipeline system with new architecture components
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing pipeline definitions
- Ensure continuous functionality during migration process
- Migrate all existing examples and templates to new system
- Update all import paths and references throughout codebase

## Dependencies
- 001: Core Architecture Foundation (needs complete architecture)
- 002: YAML Pipeline Specification (needs pipeline parsing)
- 003: Model Integration Architecture (needs model system)
- 004: Tool Integration Framework (needs tool framework)
- 005: Execution Engine Implementation (needs execution runtime)
- 006: Pipeline Orchestration (needs orchestration layer)
- 007: API Interface (needs user-facing API)

## Parallel Processing
- Cannot be parallelized (final integration phase)
- Must wait for completion of all core systems
- Sequential migration to ensure system stability

## Estimated Size
Large (5-7 days)

## Key Components
1. **Component Replacement**: Systematic replacement of old architecture components
2. **Import Path Migration**: Update all references to use new module structure
3. **Backward Compatibility Layer**: Ensure existing pipelines continue to work
4. **Example Migration**: Convert all existing examples to new format
5. **Configuration Migration**: Update all configuration files and templates
6. **Testing Integration**: Ensure all tests work with migrated system

## Success Criteria
- All existing components are successfully replaced with new architecture
- Zero breaking changes for existing pipeline definitions
- All examples and templates work with new system
- Complete test suite passes with migrated codebase
- Performance matches or exceeds previous system
- No functionality regression detected

## Notes
This is the most critical phase of the refactor. Careful planning and incremental migration strategies are essential to maintain system stability and user experience during the transition.
