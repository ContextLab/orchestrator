# Issue #383 Stream 1 Progress Report

## Stream: Core Implementation - Test Infrastructure Setup

### Status: COMPLETED ✅

### Completed Work

1. **Fixed TestModel/TestProvider Collection Warnings** ✅
   - Renamed `TestModel` → `MockTestModel` to avoid pytest collection
   - Renamed `TestProvider` → `MockTestProvider` to avoid pytest collection
   - Updated all references in `create_test_orchestrator()` function
   - All 15 infrastructure tests now pass cleanly

2. **Created Comprehensive Test Infrastructure** ✅
   - Added 15 test cases covering MockTestModel and MockTestProvider functionality
   - Tests validate model creation, generation, structured output, health checks, cost estimation
   - Tests validate provider creation, model support, capabilities, requirements, and model retrieval
   - Test for orchestrator creation with proper registry and control system setup

3. **Implemented Systematic Test Categorization System** ✅
   - Created `TestFailureInfo` dataclass for structured failure information
   - Created `TestCategorizer` class with pattern-based categorization
   - Defined 6 failure categories: infrastructure, api_compatibility, data_structure, business_logic, dependencies, environment
   - Added categorization patterns for each failure type
   - Created systematic analysis function with timeout protection

4. **Test Infrastructure Validation** ✅
   - All infrastructure tests pass: 15/15 ✅
   - Categorizer functionality validated with unit tests
   - System ready for systematic test failure analysis

### Key Infrastructure Components Created

#### MockTestModel
- Implements full Model interface with sensible defaults
- Supports both text and structured generation
- Always healthy and free for testing
- Compatible with existing model registry patterns

#### MockTestProvider  
- Provides common model names (OpenAI, Anthropic, test models)
- Implements full provider interface
- Returns consistent capabilities and requirements
- Integrates seamlessly with ModelRegistry

#### TestCategorizer
- Pattern-based failure categorization system
- Handles collection errors, timeouts, and execution failures
- Generates structured reports for systematic fixing
- Categories map to epic phases (infrastructure, API, data, business logic, deps, env)

### Next Steps for Epic Continuation

The test infrastructure is now ready for systematic application:

1. **Apply Infrastructure Patterns** - Use `create_test_orchestrator()` across failing tests
2. **Run Categorization Analysis** - Use `TestCategorizer` to identify failure groups
3. **Systematic Fixing** - Address failures by category using proven patterns
4. **Progress Tracking** - Update categorization results as fixes are applied

### Files Modified

- `/Users/jmanning/orchestrator/tests/test_infrastructure.py` - Complete infrastructure setup

### Success Metrics

- ✅ 15/15 infrastructure tests passing
- ✅ Zero pytest collection warnings
- ✅ Categorization system functional
- ✅ Patterns proven and ready for scaling

The systematic TestModel/TestProvider pattern that achieved 67% → 100% pass rate in action loop tests is now available as reusable infrastructure for the entire test categorization epic.
