# Task 001: RouteLLM Integration

## Objective
Enhance the domain router with intelligent model selection and cost optimization capabilities by integrating the RouteLLM SDK while maintaining full API compatibility.

## Scope
Focus on enhancing `src/orchestrator/models/domain_router.py` with RouteLLM SDK integration.

## Key Requirements

### Primary Goals
- Integrate RouteLLM SDK for intelligent model routing
- Maintain complete API compatibility with existing domain router
- Add cost tracking and optimization features
- Implement performance monitoring for routing decisions

### Technical Specifications
- **Target File**: `src/orchestrator/models/domain_router.py`
- **SDK**: RouteLLM SDK
- **Compatibility**: Must not break existing pipeline functionality
- **Cost Tracking**: Add granular cost monitoring per route/model
- **Performance**: Add routing decision metrics and logging

### Deliverables
1. Enhanced domain router with RouteLLM integration
2. Cost tracking and reporting functionality
3. Performance monitoring and metrics
4. Updated unit tests covering new functionality
5. Documentation for new routing capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing router interface
- Add feature flags for gradual rollout
- Implement fallback mechanisms for SDK failures
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## Success Criteria
- [ ] RouteLLM SDK successfully integrated
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Cost tracking operational
- [ ] Performance metrics available
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API
