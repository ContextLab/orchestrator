# Issue #250 Progress: POML Integration - Stream A

## Current Status: Analysis Complete, Beginning Implementation

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Research Microsoft POML SDK capabilities and features
- [x] Analyze existing template system architecture
- [x] Create comprehensive implementation plan
- [x] Document migration strategy and backward compatibility approach
- [x] Identify integration points and technical requirements

### Next Steps (In Priority Order)
1. Install and explore POML SDK
2. Create basic template format detection system
3. Implement POMLTemplateProcessor class
4. Enhance TemplateResolver with POML integration
5. Create backward compatibility validation tests

### Key Findings from Analysis

**POML SDK Capabilities:**
- HTML-like structured markup with semantic components (`<role>`, `<task>`, `<example>`)
- Advanced data integration (`<document>`, `<table>`, `<img>` components)
- Built-in templating with variables, loops, and conditionals
- CSS-like styling system for presentation control

**Integration Strategy:**
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing Jinja2 templates
- Add POML as an enhancement layer with automatic format detection
- Create hybrid template support for gradual migration
- Extend existing context system to work seamlessly with POML

**Technical Architecture:**
- `POMLTemplateProcessor` for POML-specific rendering
- `TemplateFormatDetector` for automatic format identification
- `HybridTemplateEngine` to handle mixed template formats
- Enhanced error handling and debugging tools

### Implementation Timeline

**Week 1 (Days 1-5):** Foundation and SDK Integration
**Week 2 (Days 6-10):** Core POML Features
**Week 3 (Days 11-15):** Advanced Features and Migration Tools
**Week 4 (Days 16-20):** Testing, Documentation, and Polish

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive backward compatibility testing
- Fallback mechanisms for POML processing failures
- Clear format detection rules to prevent conflicts
- Performance monitoring to ensure no degradation
