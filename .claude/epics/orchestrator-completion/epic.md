# Epic: orchestrator-completion

## Overview

Transform the orchestrator from an architectural foundation into a fully operational AI pipeline orchestration platform by implementing the three critical missing components: real step execution (replacing placeholder logic), complete YAML specification compliance per issue #307, and LLM-generated pipeline intelligence features. This epic leverages the excellent architectural foundation from the complete-refactor epic while adding the functional core that makes the orchestrator actually work.

**Technical Vision**: Extend existing StateGraph execution engine, enhance YAML compiler, and integrate orchestrator model intelligence without disrupting the clean API design already established.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technical Strategy
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing architectural foundation rather than replacing
- **StateGraph Integration**: Extend current LangGraph StateGraph implementation for real execution
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must preserve existing API contracts
- **Real Execution First**: Prioritize functional execution over advanced features

### Key Technology Choices
- **Execution Engine**: Enhance existing `StateGraphEngine` with real tool/model execution calls
- **YAML Enhancement**: Extend existing `YAMLCompiler` with missing specification features  
- **Intelligence Integration**: Add orchestrator model calls during compilation phase
- **State Management**: Leverage existing `VariableManager` and `ExecutionContext` systems
- **Error Handling**: Build on existing error recovery infrastructure

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: For model selection (cost/performance/balanced)
- **Chain of Responsibility**: For control flow routing (`on_failure`, `on_success`)
- **Factory Pattern**: For personality system prompt instantiation
- **Observer Pattern**: For real-time progress tracking integration

## Technical Approach

### Backend Services Enhancement

#### 1. Execution Engine Core (`src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py`)
**Current State**: Sophisticated StateGraph architecture with placeholder execution
**Enhancement Strategy**:
- Replace simulated step execution with real tool registry calls
- Integrate model provider APIs for actual model execution
- Connect variable management to real execution results
- Add checkpoint/resume functionality for long pipelines

#### 2. YAML Compiler Extension (`src/orchestrator/api/core.py`)
**Current State**: Basic YAML parsing with AUTO tag resolution
**Enhancement Strategy**:
- Extend parser to handle expert definitions, selection schema, personalities
- Add advanced control flow parsing (`condition`, `on_false`, `on_failure`, `on_success`)
- Integrate structured variable definitions with LangChain outputs
- Implement product file generation system

#### 3. Model Integration Layer (`src/orchestrator/models/`)
**Current State**: Well-architected provider abstractions
**Enhancement Strategy**:
- Add orchestrator model integration for pipeline intelligence
- Extend selection strategies beyond basic provider support
- Implement expert model assignment mapping
- Add intelligence generation during compilation

#### 4. Tool Execution Bridge (`src/orchestrator/tools/registry.py`)
**Current State**: Comprehensive registry with metadata
**Enhancement Strategy**: 
- Add real execution interface to existing registry
- Implement parameter passing from step definitions to tools
- Connect tool execution results to variable management
- Add execution error handling and recovery

### Infrastructure Enhancements

#### Progress Tracking Integration
- Connect existing `ProgressTracker` to real execution events
- Replace simulated progress updates with actual step monitoring
- Add execution time measurement and resource usage tracking
- Support UI callback integration for real-time updates

#### State Persistence Layer
- Enhance existing `FileStateManager` for checkpoint/resume functionality
- Add execution result persistence to variable management
- Implement state consistency validation during execution
- Support parallel execution state coordination

#### Quality Control Integration
- Connect existing quality control system to real execution results
- Add real-time output validation during execution
- Implement execution result quality assessment
- Support automated issue detection and reporting
