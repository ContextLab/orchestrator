# Error Handling & Recovery

## Overview
Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for all real execution scenarios in the orchestrator system.

## Core Focus
Build robust error recovery systems for:
- Tool execution failures and timeouts
- Model API errors and rate limiting
- State corruption and inconsistencies
- Network failures and connectivity issues
- Resource exhaustion and memory issues

## Technical Implementation

### Error Recovery System
```python
# src/orchestrator/execution/recovery.py
class ErrorRecoveryManager:
    def handle_tool_failure(self, tool_name, error, context)
    def handle_model_api_error(self, provider, error, retry_count)
    def handle_state_corruption(self, execution_id, corrupted_state)
    def attempt_graceful_recovery(self, error_type, context)
    def escalate_to_human(self, error, context, recovery_attempts)
```

### Error Classification
- **Recoverable Errors**: Network timeouts, rate limits, temporary API failures
- **State Errors**: Corrupted execution state, invalid tool outputs
- **System Errors**: Memory exhaustion, file system issues, permission errors
- **Critical Errors**: Model API key invalid, core dependencies missing

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Automatic Retry**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
2. **State Rollback**: Revert to last known good state
3. **Alternative Execution**: Use backup tools/models when primary fails
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with reduced functionality
5. **Human Escalation**: Clear error reporting for manual intervention

## Key Files to Modify
- `src/orchestrator/execution/recovery.py` - Core recovery logic
- `src/orchestrator/execution/executor.py` - Integrate error handling
- `src/orchestrator/tools/manager.py` - Tool failure recovery
- `src/orchestrator/models/manager.py` - Model API error handling
- `src/orchestrator/api/error_handlers.py` - API error responses
- `src/orchestrator/state/manager.py` - State corruption recovery

## Acceptance Criteria

### Error Detection & Classification
- [ ] All error types are properly classified and logged
- [ ] Error context includes execution state and recovery options
- [ ] Errors are propagated with full stack traces for debugging
- [ ] Error metrics are collected for monitoring

### Recovery Mechanisms
- [ ] Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors
- [ ] State rollback functionality for corrupted executions
- [ ] Alternative tool/model selection when primary fails
- [ ] Graceful degradation maintains core functionality
- [ ] Human escalation includes actionable error information

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Tool failure scenarios trigger appropriate recovery
- [ ] Model API errors are handled with retry logic
- [ ] State corruption detection and rollback works
- [ ] Network failures don't crash the system
- [ ] Memory pressure triggers resource cleanup

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Error handling doesn't introduce performance overhead
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms don't create infinite loops
- [ ] Error logs are structured for monitoring systems
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascade failures

## Definition of Done
- All error scenarios have defined recovery strategies
- Error handling is integrated throughout the system
- Recovery mechanisms are tested with real failure scenarios
- Error reporting provides actionable information for debugging
- System degrades gracefully under various failure conditions
- Documentation covers all error types and recovery procedures

## Dependencies
Requires completion of all previous tasks (324-329) as this integrates error handling across all system components.

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with most common error scenarios (network, API failures)
- Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures
- Ensure recovery mechanisms don't introduce new failure modes
- Test error handling with real external API failures
