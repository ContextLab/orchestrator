# Analysis: Model Selection Intelligence

## Overview
This issue implements intelligent model selection strategies to complete the orchestrator API. It builds on the existing model registry and provider infrastructure to add cost/performance/balanced selection strategies, tool-specific model assignment capabilities, and runtime optimization algorithms.

## Current State Analysis
The codebase has solid foundations for model selection intelligence:

**Existing Strengths:**
- ModelRegistry with unified provider management and cost/performance metadata
- ModelCapabilities with accuracy_score, speed_rating, and domain specialization
- ModelCost with detailed token pricing and efficiency scoring methods
- TaskDelegationTool providing basic model selection based on task requirements
- Pipeline execution engine with model integration points
- Comprehensive API type system supporting model configuration

**Current Gaps:**
- No selection_schema field implementation in pipeline specifications
- Missing experts field for tool-specific model assignments
- No runtime selection algorithm for cost/performance/balanced strategies
- Limited integration between model registry and execution engine
- No comprehensive model selection testing across all strategies

## Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: Selection Schema & Runtime Algorithm
- **Agent Type**: code-analyzer
- **Files**: 
  - `src/orchestrator/models/selection.py` (new)
  - `src/orchestrator/models/registry.py` (enhance)
  - `src/orchestrator/core/pipeline.py` (update)
  - `tests/models/test_selection.py` (new)
- **Dependencies**: none
- **Can Start**: immediately
- **Scope**: Implement selection_schema support and runtime selection algorithms for cost/performance/balanced strategies. Add model scoring and ranking algorithms that leverage existing ModelCost and ModelCapabilities metadata.

### Stream B: Experts Field & Tool-Model Assignment
- **Agent Type**: parallel-worker
- **Files**:
  - `src/orchestrator/tools/experts.py` (new)
  - `src/orchestrator/models/assignment.py` (new)
  - `src/orchestrator/api/types.py` (update)
  - `tests/tools/test_experts.py` (new)
- **Dependencies**: none
- **Can Start**: immediately
- **Scope**: Implement experts field in pipeline specifications enabling tool-specific model assignments. Create expert assignment engine that maps tools to optimal models based on specialization and requirements.

### Stream C: Registry Enhancement & Performance Metadata
- **Agent Type**: code-analyzer
- **Files**:
  - `src/orchestrator/models/registry.py` (enhance)
  - `src/orchestrator/models/providers/base.py` (update)
  - `src/orchestrator/models/performance.py` (new)
  - `tests/models/test_performance.py` (new)
- **Dependencies**: none
- **Can Start**: immediately
- **Scope**: Extend model registry with enhanced performance metadata collection, runtime performance tracking, and model benchmarking capabilities. Build on existing ModelMetrics and ModelCost structures.

### Stream D: Integration & Pipeline Execution
- **Agent Type**: general-purpose
- **Files**:
  - `src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py` (integrate)
  - `src/orchestrator/execution/model_selector.py` (new)
  - `src/orchestrator/api/execution.py` (update)
  - `tests/execution/test_model_selection.py` (new)
- **Dependencies**: Stream A, Stream B
- **Can Start**: after Stream A and B core components
- **Scope**: Integrate selection algorithms and expert assignments into pipeline execution engine. Implement runtime model selection during step execution.

### Stream E: Testing & Production Polish
- **Agent Type**: test-runner
- **Files**:
  - `tests/integration/test_model_selection.py` (new)
  - `tests/api/test_model_intelligence.py` (new)
  - `examples/model_selection_demo.yaml` (update)
- **Dependencies**: Stream A, Stream B, Stream C, Stream D
- **Can Start**: after core streams complete
- **Scope**: Comprehensive integration testing with real API calls for all model selection scenarios. Performance optimization and error handling validation. Production readiness validation.

## Integration Points

**Stream A ↔ Stream B**: Selection algorithm results feed into expert assignment engine
**Stream A ↔ Stream C**: Selection algorithms use enhanced registry performance metadata
**Stream B ↔ Stream C**: Expert assignments leverage registry model capabilities data
**Stream D**: Integrates outputs from A, B, C into execution engine
**Stream E**: Validates integration of all streams through comprehensive testing

## Testing Strategy

**Stream A Testing**: 
- Unit tests for selection algorithms (cost/performance/balanced)
- Model scoring and ranking validation
- Edge case handling (no suitable models, budget constraints)

**Stream B Testing**:
- Expert assignment accuracy tests
- Tool-model compatibility validation
- Fallback mechanism testing

**Stream C Testing**:
- Performance metadata collection accuracy
- Registry enhancement functionality
- Model benchmarking validation

**Stream D Testing**:
- Runtime selection integration tests
- Pipeline execution with intelligent selection
- Error handling and recovery scenarios

**Stream E Testing**:
- End-to-end integration tests with real models
- Performance optimization validation
- Production readiness assessment

## Success Criteria

1. **selection_schema implemented**: Pipelines support cost/performance/balanced strategies
2. **experts field functional**: Tools can be assigned specific models with validation
3. **Runtime selection operational**: Dynamic model selection during execution based on strategy
4. **Registry enhanced**: Cost and performance metadata enables intelligent selection decisions
5. **Integration complete**: All components work together seamlessly in production
6. **Testing comprehensive**: Real API calls validate all selection scenarios
7. **Performance optimized**: Production-ready error handling and monitoring
8. **Epic compliance**: 100% compliance with issue #307 requirements achieved

The parallel streams are designed to minimize file conflicts while ensuring comprehensive delivery of the model selection intelligence system. Each stream can begin immediately except for Stream D (requires A+B) and Stream E (requires all others).
