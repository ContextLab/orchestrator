# Execution Status

## Active Issues
- Issue #342: Real Execution Engine Implementation - ‚úÖ Analysis Complete, Implementation Started

## Analysis Results - Issue #342
üö® CRITICAL FINDING: Mock execution in lines 487-496 of src/orchestrator/execution/engine.py must be replaced with real tool/model execution

### Work Streams Identified:
1. **Core Execution Engine Replacement** (Blocking - IN PROGRESS)
   - Replace mock logic in _execute_single_step method
   - Integrate real tool registry and model providers
   
2. **Tool Integration** (Ready after Stream 1)
   - Parameter passing and tool invocation
   
3. **Model Provider Integration** (Ready after Stream 1) 
   - Real API calls instead of mocks
   
4. **Variable State Management** (Ready after Stream 1)
   - Proper template resolution with real values
   
5. **File Generation & Output** (Final integration)
   - Real output files from actual execution results

## Blocked Issues (4) - Waiting for #342
- Issue #343: Pipeline Intelligence & Result API
- Issue #344: Control Flow Routing System  
- Issue #345: Personality & Variable Systems
- Issue #346: Model Selection Intelligence

## Next Actions
1. Complete core execution replacement in Stream 1
2. Test with existing pipeline definitions
3. Launch remaining work streams once foundation is solid
4. Unblock dependent issues #343-346
