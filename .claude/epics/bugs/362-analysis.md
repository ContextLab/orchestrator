# Issue 362 Analysis: Epic Analysis and Planning

## Overview
This issue focuses on analyzing epic requirements and creating detailed implementation plans.

## Analysis Summary
The task involves:
1. **Epic Requirements Review**: Analyze existing epic structure and requirements
2. **Implementation Planning**: Create detailed implementation plans with technical specifications
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify and document technical dependencies
4. **Progress Tracking**: Set up systematic progress tracking mechanisms

## Parallel Execution Streams

### Stream 1: Epic Structure Analysis
**Prerequisites**: None (can start immediately)
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours
**Tasks**:
- Review existing epic directory structure
- Analyze task organization patterns
- Document current epic workflow
- Identify gaps in epic management

### Stream 2: Implementation Planning Framework
**Prerequisites**: None (can start immediately)  
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 hours
**Tasks**:
- Design implementation planning templates
- Create dependency mapping system
- Establish progress tracking mechanisms
- Document planning best practices

### Stream 3: Technical Integration
**Prerequisites**: Streams 1 & 2 partial completion
**Estimated Time**: 3-7 hours
**Tasks**:
- Integrate epic analysis with existing systems
- Implement automated planning tools
- Create validation mechanisms
- Test integration points

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Epic structure analysis (existing patterns)
- **Medium Risk**: Implementation planning framework (new patterns)
- **Medium Risk**: Technical integration (system dependencies)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Epic analysis framework completed
- [ ] Implementation planning system operational
- [ ] Technical integration validated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests written and passing

## Dependencies
- Access to epic directory structure
- Understanding of current workflow patterns
- Integration with existing PM tools

## Completion Strategy
1. Launch parallel streams 1 & 2 immediately
2. Begin stream 3 when streams 1 & 2 are 50% complete
3. Continuous integration testing throughout
4. Final validation and documentation
