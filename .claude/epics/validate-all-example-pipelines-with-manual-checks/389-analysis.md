# Issue #389 Analysis: Integration Implementation

## Epic Context
Epic: validate-all-example-pipelines-with-manual-checks

## Implementation Plan
Based on the systematic pipeline validation patterns and integration with proven test infrastructure:

### Work Streams

**Stream A: Integration Infrastructure**
- Apply proven TestModel/TestProvider patterns for pipeline validation
- Implement integration components for example pipeline execution
- Use established model registry and orchestrator patterns
- Can start immediately: Yes

**Stream B: API Endpoint Implementation**  
- Create API endpoints for pipeline validation and execution
- Apply systematic integration patterns from orchestrator infrastructure
- Dependencies: After Stream A infrastructure setup

**Stream C: Pipeline Integration Validation**
- Validate all example pipelines using systematic testing approach
- Apply proven result structure patterns and validation methodology
- Dependencies: After Streams A & B completion

### Success Criteria
- Integration components implemented using proven orchestrator patterns
- API endpoints functional and validated with systematic testing
- All example pipelines validated using established testing infrastructure
- Integration with existing orchestrator framework verified

## Next Steps
Ready for parallel execution using established systematic patterns from the successful testing epic infrastructure.
