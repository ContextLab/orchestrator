# Task: Implement comprehensive reporting system

## Description
Build a reporting system that aggregates validation results into comprehensive reports at multiple levels: individual pipeline reports, category summaries, and executive dashboard. Reports should be generated in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON) and include quality scores, issues found, trends, and remediation priorities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Individual pipeline validation reports generated
- [ ] Category-level summary reports created
- [ ] Executive dashboard with key metrics
- [ ] Multiple output formats supported (MD, HTML, JSON)
- [ ] Issue prioritization matrix included
- [ ] Historical trend charts integrated

## Technical Details
- **Report hierarchy**:
  ```
  validation/reports/
  ├── 2025-08-23_103000/
  │   ├── dashboard.md              # Executive summary
  │   ├── dashboard.html            # Interactive HTML version
  │   ├── summary.json             # Machine-readable summary
  │   ├── by_category/
  │   │   ├── data_processing.md
  │   │   ├── research.md
  │   │   └── creative.md
  │   └── by_pipeline/
  │       ├── auto_tags_demo.md
  │       └── creative_image_pipeline.md
  └── latest -> 2025-08-23_103000/
  ```
- **Dashboard metrics**:
  - Overall quality score (weighted average)
  - Pass/fail rate
  - Critical issues count
  - Top 10 issues by frequency
  - Quality trend (improving/declining)
  - Pipeline execution success rate
- **Report sections**:
  - Executive summary
  - Quality metrics by category
  - Issue breakdown by severity
  - Remediation priorities
  - Historical trends
  - Detailed findings

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (quality scores)
- [ ] Task 003 (assessment rubrics)
- [ ] Task 005 (issue detection)
- [ ] Markdown/HTML generation libraries
- [ ] Charting library (matplotlib/plotly)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 12 hours
- Parallel: false (requires other components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All report types generated successfully
- [ ] HTML reports are interactive and professional
- [ ] JSON format documented with schema
- [ ] Charts and visualizations working
- [ ] Report generation automated
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<30s for full suite)
