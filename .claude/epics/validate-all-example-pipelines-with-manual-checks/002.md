# Task: Implement structured output capture and organization

## Description
Create a systematic output capture system that organizes pipeline execution results into a structured directory hierarchy. Each pipeline run should have its outputs captured in timestamped directories with consistent naming conventions, making it easy to compare outputs across validation cycles and track quality trends over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory structure defined: `examples/outputs/validation/{timestamp}/{pipeline_name}/`
- [ ] Automatic timestamping for each validation run
- [ ] Output file categorization (reports, images, data files, logs)
- [ ] Metadata file created per pipeline with execution details
- [ ] Symlink to "latest" validation run for easy access
- [ ] Cleanup utility for old validation runs (keep last N runs)

## Technical Details
- **Directory structure**:
  ```
  examples/outputs/validation/
  ├── 2025-08-23_103000/
  │   ├── manifest.json
  │   ├── auto_tags_demo/
  │   │   ├── output.md
  │   │   ├── metadata.json
  │   │   └── quality_score.json
  │   └── creative_image_pipeline/
  │       ├── images/
  │       ├── output.md
  │       └── quality_score.json
  └── latest -> 2025-08-23_103000/
  ```
- **Metadata tracking**: Execution time, inputs used, model versions, errors
- **File organization**: Group by type (text, images, data)
- **Integration point**: `validate_pipeline()` method in validator

## Dependencies
- [ ] Filesystem access
- [ ] Python pathlib for path management
- [ ] JSON for metadata storage

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S (Small)
- Hours: 6 hours
- Parallel: true (independent of scoring system)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Directory structure creation automated
- [ ] Output capture integrated with validator
- [ ] Metadata files generated for each run
- [ ] Symlink management implemented
- [ ] Cleanup utility created
- [ ] Documentation updated with structure details
