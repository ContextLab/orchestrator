# Task: Enhance validator script with quality scoring system

## Description
Extend the existing `scripts/validate_all_pipelines.py` script to include a comprehensive quality scoring system that evaluates pipeline outputs across five dimensions: correctness, completeness, formatting, usability, and performance. The scoring system should generate both machine-readable JSON and human-readable reports.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Quality scoring class implemented with 5 dimensions (0-100 scale)
- [ ] Weighted scoring calculation (30% correctness, 25% completeness, 20% formatting, 15% usability, 10% performance)
- [ ] JSON schema defined for quality scores and issues
- [ ] Automated scoring for basic quality checks (template artifacts, debug text, missing sections)
- [ ] Integration with existing PipelineValidator class
- [ ] Score persistence to JSON files in validation output directory

## Technical Details
- **File to modify**: `scripts/validate_all_pipelines.py`
- **New components**:
  - `QualityScorer` class with dimension scoring methods
  - `ValidationResult` dataclass for structured results
  - JSON schema for quality reports
- **Quality dimensions**:
  - Correctness: Validate outputs match expected structure
  - Completeness: Check for missing sections or data
  - Formatting: Detect template artifacts, debug text
  - Usability: Assess clarity and professionalism
  - Performance: Track execution time and resource usage

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing `validate_all_pipelines.py` script
- [ ] OutputSanitizer for detecting conversational markers
- [ ] Python dataclasses for structured data

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M (Medium)
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other foundation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Quality scoring system implemented and tested
- [ ] JSON output schema documented
- [ ] Integration with existing validator complete
- [ ] Unit tests for scoring logic
- [ ] Sample quality reports generated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
