# Advanced Infrastructure Pipeline Development

Develop missing advanced infrastructure capabilities to enable the 3 most sophisticated pipelines that represent the platform's cutting-edge features.

## Problem Statement

Issue #283 validation revealed that the 3 most advanced pipelines are completely non-functional due to missing infrastructure capabilities:

1. **iterative_fact_checker.yaml** (#172): Recursive processing with template dependencies - 0% functional
2. **original_research_report_pipeline.yaml** (#186): Advanced syntax (95% → 100% completion) - missing declarative features  
3. **enhanced_research_pipeline.yaml** (#173): Complex research capabilities - limited by template system

These represent the platform's most sophisticated capabilities and require advanced infrastructure development.

## Infrastructure Gap Analysis

### Advanced Template Pattern Support (Critical)
**Current State**: Template system fails with nested contexts, conditional rendering, recursive patterns
**Required Features**:
- Recursive template resolution in iterative contexts
- Conditional template rendering based on execution state
- Loop-based template generation with state preservation
- Complex data structure template exposure

### Declarative Pipeline Syntax (High Priority)
**Current State**: original_research_report_pipeline.yaml 95% complete, missing advanced syntax
**Required Features**:
- Declarative configuration patterns
- Advanced pipeline composition
- Dynamic step generation
- Complex dependency management

### Enhanced Research Infrastructure (Medium Priority)
**Current State**: Basic research works, advanced capabilities limited
**Required Features**:
- Multi-source research coordination
- Advanced content synthesis
- Quality assessment integration
- Iterative research refinement

## Solution Architecture

**Focus Pipeline**: `iterative_fact_checker.yaml` (#172)

### Stream B: Declarative Syntax Framework (High Priority)  
**Target**: Complete advanced syntax support for sophisticated pipeline composition
- Implement missing declarative configuration patterns
- Build advanced pipeline composition features
- Create dynamic step generation capabilities
- Develop complex dependency management system

**Focus Pipeline**: `original_research_report_pipeline.yaml` (#186)

### Stream C: Enhanced Research Capabilities (Medium Priority)
**Target**: Build advanced research infrastructure for complex research workflows
- Implement multi-source research coordination
- Build advanced content synthesis capabilities
- Integrate quality assessment throughout research process
- Create iterative research refinement system

**Focus Pipeline**: `enhanced_research_pipeline.yaml` (#173)

### Stream D: Integration Testing & Documentation (All Streams)
**Target**: Comprehensive testing and documentation of new advanced capabilities
- Test all 3 advanced pipelines with new infrastructure
- Document new advanced features and patterns
- Create usage examples for new capabilities
- Validate integration with existing infrastructure

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Advanced Template Resolution Engine

#### Recursive Template Processing
```python
class RecursiveTemplateResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.iteration_context = {}
        self.state_stack = []
        
    def resolve_iterative_templates(self, template: str, iteration_data: dict) -> str:
        """Resolve templates with recursive iteration context"""
        # Maintain iteration state across recursive calls
        # Support nested template contexts
        # Handle loop variable scoping
```

#### Conditional Template Rendering
```python
class ConditionalTemplateRenderer:
    def render_conditional_templates(self, template: str, execution_state: dict) -> str:
        """Render templates based on execution state and conditions"""
        # Support if/then/else in templates
        # Handle dynamic template selection
        # Maintain template cache for performance
```

### Declarative Syntax Framework

#### Advanced Configuration Parser
```yaml
# Example advanced syntax patterns needed
research_pipeline:
  type: declarative
  composition:
    dynamic_steps: true
    dependency_resolution: advanced
    conditional_execution: state-based
  
  steps:
    - step_type: research_coordinator
      generates: [source_analysis, quality_metrics]
      conditions: 
        - quality_threshold: 0.8
        - source_diversity: minimum_3
```

### Enhanced Research Infrastructure

#### Multi-Source Research Coordination
```python
class AdvancedResearchCoordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.source_managers = []
        self.synthesis_engine = ContentSynthesisEngine()
        self.quality_assessor = ResearchQualityAssessor()
        
    def coordinate_research(self, research_query: str) -> ResearchResult:
        """Coordinate research across multiple sources with quality control"""
        # Parallel source research
        # Content synthesis
        # Quality assessment
        # Iterative refinement
```
