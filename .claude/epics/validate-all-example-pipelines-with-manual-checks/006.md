# Task: Develop comparison tools for output validation

## Description
Create tools for comparing pipeline outputs across validation runs, enabling reviewers to identify regressions, improvements, and consistency issues. The tools should support side-by-side comparison, diff visualization, and trend analysis for quality scores over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Side-by-side output comparison script implemented
- [ ] Diff visualization for text outputs (similar to git diff)
- [ ] Image comparison support for visual pipelines
- [ ] Quality score trend analysis across runs
- [ ] Regression detection and alerting
- [ ] Command-line interface for comparison operations

## Technical Details
- **Comparison features**:
  - Text diff with context lines
  - Structured data comparison (JSON/CSV)
  - Image similarity metrics
  - Quality score deltas
  - Execution time comparisons
- **CLI commands**:
  ```bash
  # Compare two validation runs
  python validation/compare.py --run1 2025-08-23_103000 --run2 2025-08-24_103000
  
  # Compare specific pipeline across all runs
  python validation/compare.py --pipeline creative_image_pipeline --history
  
  # Generate regression report
  python validation/compare.py --regression-check --baseline 2025-08-23_103000
  ```
- **Output formats**:
  - Terminal-friendly colored diff
  - HTML report with visual comparisons
  - JSON data for programmatic access
- **Trend analysis**: Track quality scores, execution times, issue counts

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (structured output directories)
- [ ] Python difflib for text comparison
- [ ] Pillow/OpenCV for image comparison
- [ ] Matplotlib for trend visualization

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M (Medium)
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: true (independent tool development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All comparison features implemented
- [ ] CLI interface documented and tested
- [ ] HTML report generation working
- [ ] Image comparison functional
- [ ] Trend analysis charts generated
- [ ] Performance acceptable for large outputs
