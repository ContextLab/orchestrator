# Tutorial Documentation System (GitHub #214)

Create comprehensive tutorial documentation for all validated example pipelines, enabling users to learn the orchestrator toolbox effectively and remix examples to build their own pipelines.

## Problem Statement

Currently, example pipelines lack the comprehensive documentation needed for effective learning:

1. **No Syntax Explanation**: Users don't understand why specific configurations are used
2. **Missing Use Cases**: No clear explanation of when and why to use each pattern  
3. **No Customization Guidance**: Users can't effectively modify examples for their needs
4. **No Remixing Instructions**: No guidance on combining examples to build new pipelines
5. **Incomplete Feature Coverage**: Not all major toolbox features are documented through examples

## Solution Architecture

### Comprehensive Tutorial System
**Create structured learning materials for all validated pipelines**

```python
class TutorialGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pipeline_analyzer = PipelineAnalyzer()
        self.feature_mapper = FeatureMapper()
        self.tutorial_template = TutorialTemplate()
        
    def generate_comprehensive_tutorials(self) -> TutorialSuite:
        """Generate complete tutorial documentation for all pipelines"""
        
        validated_pipelines = self._get_validated_pipelines()  # From Tasks 005-006
        
        tutorials = {}
        for pipeline in validated_pipelines:
            tutorials[pipeline] = self._generate_pipeline_tutorial(pipeline)
            
        # Create feature coverage matrix
        feature_matrix = self._create_feature_coverage_matrix(tutorials)
        
        # Build progressive learning path
        learning_path = self._create_learning_progression(tutorials)
        
        return TutorialSuite(tutorials, feature_matrix, learning_path)
```
