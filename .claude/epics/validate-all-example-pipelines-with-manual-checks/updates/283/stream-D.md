### ‚ùå Web Search Pipeline - FAILED
- **Web Search**: Successfully retrieved search results (web search working)
- **Report Generator**: Failed - Tool 'report-generator' not found
- **Root Cause**: Pipeline depends on non-existent report-generator tool
- **Search Results**: Retrieved 5 results about AI trends 2024 successfully

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED - Missing tool dependency (report-generator)

## 2025-08-27T20:10:00Z - iterative_fact_checker_simple.yaml Execution Results

### ‚ùå Simple Iterative Fact Checker - FAILED
- **Document Loading**: Successfully loaded test document

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED - Consistent structured generation issues

## 2025-08-27T20:12:00Z - web_research_pipeline.yaml Analysis

### ‚ùå Web Research Pipeline - DEPENDENCIES MISSING
- **Analysis**: Pipeline uses non-existent report-generator tool extensively  
- **Dependencies**: Steps 8, 9 require report-generator which doesn't exist
- **Web Search**: Would work (based on other pipeline results)
- **Complex Features**: Uses headless-browser, foreach loops, and advanced templates
- **Not Executed**: Skipped due to known missing dependencies

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT TESTED - Missing critical tool dependencies

### EPIC COMPLETION STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è BELOW THRESHOLD

**Final Assessment**: 43% average quality - **DOES NOT MEET 90% THRESHOLD**

Stream D demonstrates strong external API integration capabilities (web search, MCP) but is severely hampered by systematic issues in structured generation, template resolution, and missing tool dependencies. The research and integration pipelines show the platform's potential but require significant infrastructure fixes to be production-ready.

**Recommendation**: Focus on resolving structured generation issues and template resolution system before continuing with advanced pipeline development.
