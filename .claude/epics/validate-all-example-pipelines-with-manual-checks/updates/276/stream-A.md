## Files/Directories to Clean

### Cache Directories Found:
- 34 __pycache__ directories across the repository
- 1 .mypy_cache directory at repository root
- All containing .pyc files (compiled Python bytecode)

### Temporary Files Found:
- /Users/jmanning/orchestrator/src/orchestrator/core/error_handler.py.tmp
- Various debug files within .mypy_cache (will be removed with cache)

### Safety Backup Files:
- temp/safety_backups/root_org_backup_20250825_104603/ (contains test files and backups)

## Cleanup Results

### Files and Directories Removed:
- **34 __pycache__ directories** - Removed all compiled Python bytecode cache directories
- **1 .mypy_cache directory** - Removed MyPy type checker cache (root level)
- **1 temporary file** - `/Users/jmanning/orchestrator/src/orchestrator/core/error_handler.py.tmp`
- **temp/safety_backups/ directory** - Removed old backup directory (files already moved to proper locations)

### Repository Size Impact:
- Significantly reduced repository size by removing cache files and temporary data
- Eliminated unnecessary development artifacts
- Cleaned up safety backup files that had served their purpose

### .gitignore Enhancements:
- Added `debug_*` pattern to ignore debug files
- Added `.temp*` pattern to ignore hidden temporary files  
- Added `temp_*` pattern to ignore temporary files with prefix

### Quality Improvements:
- ✅ Zero temporary files remain in repository
- ✅ All cache directories removed and prevented from future commits
- ✅ Professional appearance achieved through cleanup
- ✅ Repository ready for continued development

## Commits Made
