# Issue #276 Stream C: Output Directory Standardization

**Status**: Starting
**Started**: 2025-08-26
**Focus**: Standardize naming conventions across output directories and organize example outputs into consistent structure

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Created Stream C tracking file
- [ ] Analyze current output directory structure inconsistencies
- [ ] Identify generic filenames that need input-specific naming
- [ ] Standardize file naming conventions across all pipeline outputs
- [ ] Clean up inconsistent or duplicate output files
- [ ] Organize pipeline outputs with clear categorization
- [ ] Update pipeline configurations if needed for path changes
- [ ] Validate all pipelines still work with new structure

## Tasks In Progress
- [x] Analyzing current examples/outputs structure

## Tasks Pending
- All standardization tasks pending

## Current Analysis

### Output Directory Structure Issues Identified

From initial analysis of `/Users/jmanning/orchestrator/examples/outputs/`, several patterns emerge:

1. **Inconsistent file naming patterns** - Some use timestamps, some use generic names, some use input-specific names
2. **Mixed organization approaches** - Some pipelines have subdirectories, others dump files in root
3. **Generic filenames** - Files like "output.csv", "report.md" instead of input-specific names
4. **Inconsistent timestamp formats** - Multiple timestamp formats used across pipelines
5. **Archive patterns** - Some pipelines have archive/ subdirectories, others don't

### Pipelines Requiring Standardization

Will analyze each pipeline's output structure for:
- Generic vs input-specific filenames
- Consistent directory organization
- Proper file extensions (.csv for data, .md for reports, .json for metadata)
- Clean archive/backup organization

## Success Criteria for Stream C

- ✅ Consistent output directory structure across all pipelines
- ✅ Input-specific filenames (no generic names like "output.csv")
- ✅ Clean archive organization where appropriate
- ✅ Consistent file extensions (.csv, .md, .json)
- ✅ All example pipelines execute successfully with new structure
- ✅ No broken references to old paths
