## Stream D Results

### Documentation Updates Completed

#### 1. Main README.md Updates
- ✅ **Script Path References**: Updated API key setup script reference to `scripts/utilities/setup_api_keys.py`
- ✅ **Example Output References**: Updated output file references to reflect standardized naming from Stream C:
  - `filtered_output.csv` → `input_processed_data.csv`
  - `analysis_report.md` → `input_processing_report.md`
- ✅ **Repository Structure Diagram**: Updated complete directory structure to reflect new script organization with 5 subdirectories
- ✅ **Script Organization Documentation**: Added comprehensive script categorization showing execution, validation, testing, utilities, production, and maintenance

#### 2. Examples README.md Updates  
- ✅ **Pipeline Execution Instructions**: Updated all `run_pipeline.py` references to use new path `scripts/execution/run_pipeline.py`
- ✅ **Output File References**: Updated pipeline output examples to match Stream C standardized naming:
  - Simple data processing outputs now reference correctly named files
  - Control flow loop outputs reference `processing_summary.md`

#### 3. Cross-Reference Validation
- ✅ **Documentation Links**: All documentation cross-references verified functional
- ✅ **File Path Consistency**: All file paths in documentation match actual new structure
- ✅ **No Broken References**: Comprehensive check found no broken links or outdated references

### Quality Assurance Testing Results

#### 1. Script Functionality Validation
- ✅ **Validation Scripts**: `scripts/validation/quick_validate.py` working correctly
- ✅ **Execution Scripts**: `scripts/execution/run_pipeline.py` working correctly  
- ✅ **Pipeline Testing**: Successfully executed `simple_data_processing.yaml` with new structure
- ✅ **Template Resolution**: All templates resolving correctly with updated paths
- ✅ **Output Generation**: Timestamped outputs generating correctly in standardized structure

#### 2. Repository Organization Assessment
- ✅ **Root Directory**: Clean and professional (16 files, minimal scattered files)
- ✅ **Script Organization**: 6 well-organized subdirectories with appropriate categorization
- ✅ **Directory Naming**: All directories follow consistent naming conventions
- ✅ **Output Structure**: Clean, standardized pipeline output directories
- ⚠️ **Note**: Large checkpoint system (~10K files) flagged by validator but this is expected and not an issue
