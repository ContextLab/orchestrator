# PRD: explore-wrappers

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the research, evaluation, and integration of external mature tools to replace custom implementations in the orchestrator toolbox, specifically focusing on RouteLLM, Microsoft POML, and LangChain Deep Agents. The goal is to reduce bugs, improve reliability and performance, while maintaining the existing API and pipeline compatibility through carefully designed wrapper layers.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Custom Implementation Burden**: The orchestrator toolbox implements significant functionality from scratch, leading to bugs and maintenance overhead
2. **Reliability Issues**: Custom implementations have rough edges and stability problems that mature external tools have already solved
3. **Performance Gaps**: Hand-rolled solutions may not match the optimization level of specialized external tools
4. **Development Velocity**: Time spent maintaining custom implementations could be better spent on core orchestrator features
5. **Missing Capabilities**: External tools offer advanced features that would take significant time to implement internally

### Why Now?
- Mature external tools now exist that closely match orchestrator's functionality needs
- Issues #209, #210, and #212 specifically identify promising candidates for integration
- Current custom implementations have accumulated technical debt and stability issues
- Pipeline complexity demands more robust underlying infrastructure
- Cost optimization has become critical as usage scales
