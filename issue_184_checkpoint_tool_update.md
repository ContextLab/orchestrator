# Checkpoint Tool Implementation Update

## Summary

I've successfully implemented a checkpoint extraction tool to help debug and analyze pipeline execution. This addresses the need mentioned in the issue for better visibility into checkpoint data.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created CheckpointTool (commit e8ec84f)

- **File**: `src/orchestrator/tools/checkpoint_tool.py`
- **Features**:
  - `list` action: List available checkpoints with optional pipeline name filtering
  - `inspect` action: Get summary information about a checkpoint
  - `extract` action: Export checkpoint data to human-readable formats (markdown, YAML, JSON)
  - Automatic decompression of gzipped checkpoint data
  - Smart handling of large content (truncation for readability)

### 2. Integration with Hybrid Control System

- Added checkpoint tool to the tool handlers mapping
- Tool is accessible via `metadata.tool: checkpoint` in pipeline definitions
- Works seamlessly with existing pipeline infrastructure

### 3. Human-Readable Reports

The tool generates comprehensive reports that include:
- Pipeline metadata and context
- Task execution summary grouped by status
- Detailed task results with error information
- Template rendering history when templates are present
- Previous results available for debugging

### 4. Test Pipeline (commit 28d71c6)

Created `examples/pipelines/test_checkpoint_tool.yaml` to demonstrate usage:

```yaml
name: Test Checkpoint Tool Pipeline
description: Test the checkpoint extraction tool functionality

inputs:
  pipeline_name:
    type: string
    description: Pipeline name to analyze
    default: "Advanced Research Tools"

steps:
  - id: list_checkpoints
    action: list
    metadata:
      tool: checkpoint
    parameters:
      pipeline_name: "{{ pipeline_name }}"

  - id: inspect_latest
    action: inspect
    metadata:
      tool: checkpoint
    parameters:
      pipeline_name: "{{ pipeline_name }}"

  - id: extract_to_markdown
    action: extract
    metadata:
      tool: checkpoint
    parameters:
      pipeline_name: "{{ pipeline_name }}"
      output_format: markdown
      output_file: "checkpoint_analysis_{{ pipeline_name | slugify }}.md"
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# List all checkpoints
python test_checkpoint_tool.py

# Extract specific checkpoint to markdown
result = await checkpoint_tool.execute(
    action="extract",
    checkpoint_file="Advanced_Research_Tools_Pipeline_1754064473_1754064556.json",
    output_format="markdown",
    output_file="analysis.md"
)
```

## Benefits for Debugging

1. **Template Rendering Issues**: Can now see exactly what templates were present and their values at each step
2. **Task Dependencies**: Clearly shows which tasks completed/failed before issues occurred
3. **Error Tracking**: All errors are preserved and displayed with context
4. **Pipeline State**: Full visibility into pipeline context and previous results

## Next Steps

I've created a comprehensive plan for checkpoint system improvements in `checkpoint_improvements_issue.md`. Key proposals include:
- Optional uncompressed checkpoints for easier debugging
- Enhanced checkpoint content (timing, resource usage, template history)
- Query interface for searching checkpoints
- Real-time checkpoint streaming for long-running pipelines

This tool has already proven valuable in debugging the template rendering issues - we were able to trace exactly where templates weren't being rendered by examining the checkpoint data.
