# JIT Template Rendering - Status Update

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the foundation for Just-In-Time (JIT) template rendering. The major blocker with conditional task evaluation timing has been fixed.

## What's Fixed

1. **Conditional Task Timing** ✅
   - Conditional tasks now check dependencies before evaluating conditions
   - Conditions containing templates are rendered using the template manager
   - Proper error handling for condition evaluation failures

2. **Template Dependency Analysis** ✅
   - `TemplateMetadata` class tracks template dependencies
   - `YAMLCompiler` analyzes templates during compilation
   - Task class stores template metadata for runtime use

3. **Control Flow Integration** ✅
   - Fixed `ControlFlowCompiler` to preserve template metadata
   - Conditional tasks retain their tool metadata

## Current State

The `research_advanced_tools.yaml` pipeline now runs without the condition evaluation error. However, there's still an issue with template rendering in the filesystem write operation - the markdown report contains unrendered templates.

## Remaining Issues

1. **Filesystem Write Template Rendering**
   - The filesystem tool is set up to handle runtime template rendering
   - The `_template_manager` is being passed but templates aren't being rendered
   - This needs further investigation

2. **Conditional Evaluation Results**
   - The `extract_content` step is being skipped even when search results exist
   - This might be due to how the template manager evaluates the condition

## Code Changes

### `orchestrator.py`
- Added dependency checking before conditional evaluation
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging

### `conditional.py`
- Added template rendering for conditions before evaluation
- Added logging to track condition rendering

### `auto_resolver.py`
- Enhanced logging to show condition evaluation details

## Next Steps

1. Debug why the filesystem write isn't rendering templates properly
2. Investigate why conditional evaluation might be returning false when it should be true
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for the new functionality
4. Update documentation for JIT template rendering

The foundation is solid - we just need to resolve the final template rendering issues in the filesystem tool.
