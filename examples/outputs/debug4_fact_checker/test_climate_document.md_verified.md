{% if fact_check_loop.iterations %}
I notice there are some issues with the information provided:

1. The original document shows "None"
2. The claims analysis and reference verification results appear to be Python object references rather than actual content
3. The new citations section indicates no specific claims were provided

Without the actual document content and specific claims to research, I cannot provide the requested updates. To help you properly, I would need:

**Please provide:**
1. The actual document text that needs updating
2. A list of specific claims that need citations
3. Any existing references that need to be checked or fixed

**Once you provide this information, I will:**
1. Research and add citations for all unreferenced claims using reliable sources
2. Verify and fix any broken reference URLs
3. Format all references consistently as footnotes
4. Return the complete updated document

Could you please share the actual document content and claims that need to be cited? Then I can provide you with a properly updated document with all the improvements you've requested.
