=== Iteration 2 ===
Item: {{item}}

Step 1 (generate_unique): UNIQUE_{{ITEM}}_2
Step 2 (process_data): I notice that you've provided a template for processing data, but the `{{item}}` placeholder hasn't been filled in with an actual value.

To process this data, I would need you to specify what the `{{item}}` value

Validation Checks:
- Should contain "{{item}}" in both results
- generate_unique should be: UNIQUE_{{ITEM}}_2
- process_data should reference {{item}} and its unique ID
