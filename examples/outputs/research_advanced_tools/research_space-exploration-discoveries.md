Unfortunately, I'm unable to generate an actual report based on your input because the variables such as `{{ topic }}`, `{{ search_topic.total_results }}`, `{{ analyze_quality.result.quality_score }}`, `{{ generate_summary.result }}`, `{{ generate_findings.result }}`, `{{ analyze_quality.result }}`, `{{ extract_primary_content.result }}`, and `{{ generate_recommendations.result }}` require specific data inputs or outputs from hypothetical or actual software functions that I cannot access or simulate.

To help with a potential structure, you can use the following markdown template and fill in the details manually or by using the appropriate software or data sources as you have access to:
