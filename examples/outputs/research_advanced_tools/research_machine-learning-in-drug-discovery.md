## Search Results

The analysis is based on {{ search_topic.total_results + deep_search.total_results }} sources discovered through systematic web searches. The primary search focused on recent developments in {{ topic }}, while the technical search targeted research papers and implementation details.

### Primary Sources (Top {{ search_topic.results[:10] | length }} of {{ search_topic.total_results }})
{% for result in search_topic.results[:10] %}
{{ loop.index }}. **[{{ result.title }}]({{ result.url }})**
   - {{ result.snippet }}
{% endfor %}

### Technical Sources ({{ deep_search.total_results }} results)
{% for result in deep_search.results[:5] %}
{{ loop.index }}. **[{{ result.title }}]({{ result.url }})**
   - {{ result.snippet }}
{% endfor %}

## Extracted Content Analysis

{% if extract_content is defined and 'word_count' in extract_content and extract_content.word_count > 0 %}
**Primary Source:** {{ extract_content.title }}
**URL:** {{ extract_content.url }}
**Content Summary:** Successfully extracted {{ extract_content.word_count }} words from the primary source.
{% else %}
Content extraction was not successful or was skipped.
{% endif %}

## Methodology

This comprehensive research report was generated through a multi-stage process combining automated web searches, content extraction, and AI-powered analysis. The methodology ensures broad coverage of current developments while maintaining analytical depth.

### Search Strategy
- **Primary search**: "{{ topic }} latest developments" (yielded {{ search_topic.total_results }} results)
- **Technical search**: "{{ topic }} research papers technical details implementation" (yielded {{ deep_search.total_results }} results)
- **Content extraction**: Automated extraction from primary sources when accessible
- **Analysis performed**: {{ execution.timestamp }}
