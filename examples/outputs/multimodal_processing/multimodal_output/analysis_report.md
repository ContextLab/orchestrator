## Image Analysis

### Description
This image shows a simple, minimalist design against a solid blue-gray background. In the center of the image, there is a yellow rectangular outline or border forming an empty frame. The rectangle is horizontally oriented and appears to be perfectly centered in the composition.

Above this yellow rectangle, there is white text that reads "Test Image for Pipeline" in what appears to be a clean, sans-serif font. The text is positioned in the upper portion of the image, well above the yellow rectangle.

The overall design is very clean and appears to be a placeholder or test image, as indicated by the text. The color scheme consists of just three colors: the blue-gray background, the yellow outline of the rectangle, and the white text. The simplicity and the message suggest this might be used for testing purposes in some kind of digital pipeline or workflow system.

### Detected Objects
In this image, I can identify the following objects and their locations:

1. **Text**: "Test Image for Pipeline" - Located in the upper left portion of the image, appearing in white text

2. **Rectangle**: A yellow/lime green rectangular outline - Positioned in the center of the image, creating a horizontal rectangular border or frame

3. **Background**: A solid blue-gray background color that fills the entire image

The image appears to be a simple test or placeholder image with minimal elements against a uniform background.
