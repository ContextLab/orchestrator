## 📸 Image Analysis

### Original Image
![Original Image](test_image.jpg)

### Description
- The image is a simple, square graphic with a flat, slate-blue/gray background.
- Near the left side, slightly above the vertical midpoint, there is a short line of small white sans‑serif text that reads: “Test image for Pipeline.”
- Below the text and closer to the lower half of the canvas sits a bright yellow rectangular outline (no fill). The stroke is medium‑thickness and uniform.
- The rectangle is wide and low (landscape orientation), roughly three to four times wider than it is tall. It’s centered horizontally or very close to it, with generous empty space above and below. The interior of the rectangle shows the same blue/gray background.
- There are no photos, textures, shadows, gradients, or other elements—just the single line of text and the outlined rectangle on a solid background. The overall look is that of a minimal placeholder or test graphic.

### Detected Objects
1. **Text**: "Test Image for Pipeline" - Located in the upper left portion of the image, appearing in white text
2. **Rectangle**: A yellow/lime green rectangular outline - Positioned in the center of the image, creating a horizontal rectangular border or frame
3. **Background**: A solid blue-gray background color that fills the entire image

### Frame Analysis
a simple animation frame against a black background. In the upper left portion of the frame, there is a solid blue circle. The circle appears to be a medium-sized, perfectly round shape with a bright blue color that stands out against the dark background. In the center of the image, there is white text that reads "Frame 0", indicating this is the first frame or starting position of what appears to be an animation sequence. Overall composition: minimalist, with just these two elements - the blue circle and the frame label - visible against the black backdrop.
