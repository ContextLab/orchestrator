I don't see the actual document content or the results from the fact-checking analysis in your request. You've referenced several components:

- Original document: "None"
- Claims analysis: "fact_check_loop_0_extract_claims"
- Reference verification results: "fact_check_loop_0_verify_refs"
- New citations to add: "fact_check_loop_0_find_citations"

To help you update the document with proper citations and references, I would need:

1. **The original document text** that needs to be updated
2. **The extracted claims** that require citations
3. **The verification results** showing which references are broken
4. **The new sources/citations** that should be added

Could you please provide:
- The actual document content
- The list of claims that need citations
- The sources/URLs that were found to support those claims
- Any broken references that need fixing

Once I have this information, I can help you create a properly formatted document with consistent footnote citations and fix any reference issues.
