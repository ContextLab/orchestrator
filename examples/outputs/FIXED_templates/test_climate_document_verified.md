{% if fact_check_loop.iterations %}
I notice that the document content and analysis results you've referenced appear to be empty or contain object references rather than actual text content. Specifically:

1. **Original document**: Listed as "None"
2. **Claims analysis**: Shows a Python object reference rather than actual claims
3. **Reference verification results**: Also shows an object reference
4. **New citations to add**: Contains a response indicating no specific claims were provided

To properly update your document with citations and fix broken references, I would need:

1. **The actual document text** that needs to be updated
2. **A list of specific claims** that require citations
3. **The current references** that need to be verified and fixed
4. **Any sources you've already identified** that should be added

Could you please provide:
- The complete text of the document you'd like me to update
- The specific unreferenced claims that need citations
- Any existing references that need formatting or fixing

Once I have this information, I'll be able to:
- Add proper citations for all unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken reference URLs
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document with all improvements

Please share the actual document content and claims, and I'll get started on the updates immediately.
