I notice that the original document content and the supporting analysis files (fact_check_loop_0_extract_claims, fact_check_loop_0_verify_refs, and fact_check_loop_0_find_citations) appear to be placeholder references rather than actual content. 

To properly update the document as requested, I would need:

1. **The original document text** - Currently shown as "None"
2. **Claims analysis results** - The actual extracted claims that need citations
3. **Reference verification results** - Which URLs are broken and need fixing
4. **New citations** - The sources found to support unreferenced claims

Could you please provide:
- The actual document text that needs updating
- The content of the three analysis files mentioned
- Any specific formatting preferences for the footnotes

Once I have this information, I'll be able to:
- Add proper citations for all unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken reference URLs
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document with all improvements
