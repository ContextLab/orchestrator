I don't see the actual document content or the results from the fact-checking analysis steps you mentioned. The document shows "None" and the analysis results are referenced as placeholders (fact_check_loop_0_extract_claims, fact_check_loop_0_verify_refs, fact_check_loop_0_find_citations) rather than actual content.

To help you update the document properly, I would need:

1. **The original document text** that needs to be updated
2. **The claims analysis results** showing which statements need citations
3. **The reference verification results** indicating which URLs are broken
4. **The new citations** that should be added to support unreferenced claims

Could you please provide:
- The actual document content
- The specific claims that need citations
- The broken references that need fixing
- The new sources/citations to be added

Once I have this information, I'll be happy to:
- Add proper citations for all unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken references
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document
