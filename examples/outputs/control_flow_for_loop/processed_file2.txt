## Analysis
I don’t have access to read_file.content in this chat. Please paste the text (or attach the file), and tell me how you’d like it summarized.

Options I can provide:
- Executive summary (5–8 bullets)
- One-paragraph abstract
- Key takeaways, themes, and implications
- Outline of structure/arguments
- Facts vs. opinions/claims with evidence
- Action items and open questions
- Tone, audience, and bias analysis
- Named entities, dates, figures extracted

Helpful details:
- Desired length (e.g., 100 words, 5 bullets)
- Target audience/purpose (e.g., brief for execs, study notes)
- Any sections to focus on
- Language preference

If the text is long, I can chunk it and summarize per section, then synthesize a global summary.
