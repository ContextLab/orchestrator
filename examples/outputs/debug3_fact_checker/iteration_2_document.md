I notice that the original document and supporting information (claims analysis, reference verification results, and new citations) appear to be placeholder text rather than actual content. Without the actual document text and the specific claims, broken references, and new citations to work with, I cannot provide a meaningful update.

To properly help you update your document, I would need:

1. **The original document text** - the actual content that needs updating
2. **Claims analysis results** - specific claims that need citations
3. **Reference verification results** - which URLs/references are broken
4. **New citations** - the actual sources and citation information to add

Could you please provide the actual document content and the supporting analysis? Once I have that information, I'll be happy to:

- Add proper citations for unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken references
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document

Please share the actual content, and I'll provide a thorough revision with properly formatted citations and references.
