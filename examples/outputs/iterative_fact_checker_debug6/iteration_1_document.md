I notice that the original document you referenced is listed as "None" and the citation analysis results (fact_check_loop_0_extract_claims, fact_check_loop_0_verify_refs, and fact_check_loop_0_find_citations) appear to be placeholders rather than actual content.

To properly update your document with citations and fix broken references, I would need:

1. **The actual original document text**
2. **The results of the claims analysis** showing which statements need citations
3. **The reference verification results** identifying broken URLs or problematic citations
4. **The new citations found** with their proper source information

Could you please provide:
- The original document content
- The actual results from your fact-checking analysis
- Any specific sources or citations you'd like me to incorporate

Once I have this information, I'll be happy to:
- Add proper footnote citations for all unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken or improperly formatted references
- Ensure consistent formatting throughout
- Provide a complete updated document with a properly formatted footnotes section

Please share the actual document and analysis results, and I'll provide you with a comprehensive updated version.
