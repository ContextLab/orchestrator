I understand you'd like me to update a document with citations and fix references, but I'm not able to see the actual document content or claims that need to be cited. The information you've provided appears to reference template objects that aren't displaying the actual text.

To help you properly, I would need:

1. **The original document text** - the actual content that needs citations
2. **The specific claims** that require references
3. **Any existing broken references** that need fixing

Once you provide the actual document content and specific claims, I can help you:

- Find reliable academic and authoritative sources
- Add properly formatted footnote citations
- Fix any broken reference URLs
- Ensure consistent formatting throughout

Could you please share the actual document text and the specific unreferenced claims? Then I'll be able to provide you with a complete updated document that includes proper citations and fixed references.
