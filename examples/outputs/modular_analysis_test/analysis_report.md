### 1. Data Characteristics
The dataset contains 1,000 records across 16 columns. Key performance metrics show:
- **Sales/Units Sold**: Mean of 140.8 units (range: 62-248), normally distributed around median of 138
- **Revenue**: Mean of $22,029 with high variability (std: $18,578), indicating significant revenue spread across transactions
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Average 2.97 on 1-5 scale, suggesting room for improvement
- **Conversion Rate**: Low at 2.98% average, typical for e-commerce but indicating optimization opportunities

- **Very strong positive correlation** between revenue and average_price (r=0.94), indicating revenue is primarily driven by pricing rather than volume

Weaker but notable relationships include sales positively correlating with return_rate (r=0.074), suggesting higher volume may lead to more returns.
