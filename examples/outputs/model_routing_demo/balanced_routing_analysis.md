### Document Summary
- Assigned Model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- Estimated Cost: $0.0
- Result: Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing industries globally, with increasingly sophisticated applications spanning healthcare to finance. Machine learning models now process vast amounts of data in real-time, enabling predictive analytics and automated decision-making at unprecedented scales.

### Code Generation
- Assigned Model: openai:gpt-5-nano
- Estimated Cost: $0.0025
- Code Generated: 
```python

from typing import Dict

def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization for efficiency.
    
    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (non-negative integer)
        
    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
        
    Examples:
        >>>...
```

### Data Analysis
- Assigned Model: openai:gpt-5-mini
- Estimated Cost: $0.015
- Insights: 1) Finding: Revenue +15% YoY vs Units +12% YoY and AOV +3% — revenue growth is driven more by higher AOV/product mix than unit volume.  
Why it matters: Further revenue gains can be achieved by increasing order value or promoting higher-priced categories rather than only acquiring more customers.  
Action: Run targeted price/mix tests (upsells, bundles, selective price increases) focused on Electronics and measure AOV lift and margin impact.

2) Finding: Electronics = 45% of sales (Home & Garden 30%, Clothing 25%) — high revenue concentration in Electronics.  
Why it matters: Concentration raises exposure to demand or supply shocks in one category and limits diversified growth.  
Action: Rebalance investment: allocate incremental assortment and marketing spend to Home & Garden (e.g., expand top SKUs, targeted campaigns) to reduce Electronics concentration and diversify revenue.

3) Finding: AOV growth is only +3% while units grew +12% — basket value is underleveraged.  
Why it matters: Increasing AOV is a cost-efficient lever to boost revenue without proportional acquisition spend.  
Action: Implement AOV tactics (free-shipping threshold, cart-level bundles, personalized recommendations, targeted discounts) and track weekly AOV and conversion changes.
