### Document Summary
- Assigned Model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- Estimated Cost: $0.0
- Result: Artificial intelligence is transforming industries globally, with increasingly sophisticated applications spanning healthcare and finance. Machine learning models now process vast amounts of real-time data, enabling predictive analytics and automated decision-making at unprecedented scales.

### Code Generation
- Assigned Model: google:gemini-2.0-flash
- Estimated Cost: $0.0
- Code Generated: 
```python

from typing import Dict

def fibonacci(n: int, _memo: Dict[int, int] = None) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization for optimal performance.
    
    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (0-indexed)
        _memo (Dict[int, int], optional): Internal memoization cache
    
    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number
    
   ...
```

### Data Analysis
- Assigned Model: openai:gpt-5-mini
- Estimated Cost: $0.015
- Insights: 1) Finding: Revenue grew 15% vs Units sold 12% and AOV 3% (15% â‰ˆ 12% + 3%), so growth was primarily volume-driven with only a small AOV lift.  
Why it matters: Relying on unit growth is costlier (acquisition/shipping) and limits revenue scalability; small AOV gains miss a high-leverage revenue lever.  
Action: Launch A/B tests for upsells, bundles and a $X free-shipping threshold (target AOV +5% in 2 quarters); prioritize top 20% SKUs for bundled offers to lift basket size.

2) Finding: Electronics account for 45% of sales; Home & Garden 30%, Clothing 25% (high category concentration in Electronics).  
Why it matters: Single-category concentration increases revenue volatility and supplier/market risk; limits long-term growth if Electronics demand softens.  
Action: Reallocate 15% of digital marketing spend from Electronics to Home & Garden and Clothing and accelerate assortment expansion (add 50 SKUs across those categories) to grow their combined share +5 percentage points in 2 quarters.

3) Finding: Units grew faster than revenue per unit, risking margin compression if high-volume SKUs are low-margin.  
Why it matters: Volume without margin improvement can reduce profitability despite top-line growth.  
Action: Run a 6-week margin audit by category, then implement targeted price increases or promotional reductions on lowest-margin, high-volume SKUs (target +200 basis points gross margin and AOV +3% within the next quarter).
