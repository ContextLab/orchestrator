### Document Summary
- Assigned Model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- Estimated Cost: $0.0
- Result: Artificial intelligence is transforming industries globally through increasingly sophisticated applications in sectors like healthcare and finance. Machine learning models now process vast amounts of data in real-time, enabling predictive analytics and automated decision-making at unprecedented scales.

### Code Generation
- Assigned Model: openai:gpt-5-nano
- Estimated Cost: $0.0025
- Code Generated: 
```python

from typing import Union

def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach.
    
    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (0-indexed)
        
    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
        OverflowError: If the result would be too large to...
```

### Data Analysis
- Assigned Model: openai:gpt-5-mini
- Estimated Cost: $0.015
- Insights: 1) Finding: Revenue +15% YoY vs Units +12% YoY → AOV +3% to $167.  
   Why it matters: Revenue growth partly driven by higher spend per order; small AOV gain limits revenue leverage from existing traffic.  
   Action: Run targeted upsell/bundle tests in checkout for high‑share categories (start with Electronics and Home & Garden) to raise AOV.

2) Finding: Electronics account for 45% of sales; Home & Garden 30%, Clothing 25% (top‑heavy distribution).  
   Why it matters: Heavy reliance on Electronics creates concentration risk and limits diversification of growth drivers.  
   Action: Shift incremental marketing and assortment investment toward Home & Garden and Clothing to grow their shares and reduce Electronics dependency.

3) Finding: Units sold 15,000 (12% YoY) shows healthy volume growth, but AOV growth is modest (3%), capping lifetime value expansion.  
   Why it matters: Sustained margins and scalable revenue require higher repeat purchase rates and monetization per customer.  
   Action: Launch retention programs (subscriptions/loyalty/targeted post‑purchase offers) for Home & Garden and Clothing to boost repeat rate and customer LTV.
