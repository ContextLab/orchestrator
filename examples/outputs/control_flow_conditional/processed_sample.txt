# Processed File

Original size: 150 bytes
Processing type: Expanded

## Result

This is a sample text file for testing conditional processing. It contains multiple lines of text. The pipeline should process this based on its size.

This 150-byte test file serves as a boundary case specimen for automated data processing systems that implement size-based routing logic. Files of this compact size typically fall into the "small file" category within most processing frameworks, triggering specific handling procedures optimized for minimal overhead operations.

The multi-line structure demonstrates realistic text file formatting while maintaining a controlled data volume suitable for unit testing scenarios. Processing pipelines often establish size thresholds—such as 100 bytes, 1KB, or 10KB—to determine whether files should undergo lightweight processing, batch aggregation, or individual handling workflows.

In conditional processing architectures, files at this size range frequently bypass resource-intensive operations like distributed processing or complex parsing algorithms. Instead, they typically route through streamlined pathways designed for rapid throughput. The predictable content and known byte count make this file format ideal for validating pipeline decision trees, testing size-based conditional statements, and ensuring proper classification logic functions correctly across different file categories.

Such test files enable developers to verify that processing systems correctly identify file characteristics, apply appropriate transformation rules, and route data through the intended processing branches based on predetermined size criteria and content patterns.
