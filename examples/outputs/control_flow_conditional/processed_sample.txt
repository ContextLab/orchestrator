## Result

This is a sample text file created specifically for the purpose of testing conditional processing within data pipelines. The file contains multiple lines of text, each designed to simulate typical content that might be encountered during real-world data ingestion and transformation tasks. The pipeline responsible for handling this file is expected to analyze its contents and make decisions based on the overall size of the file. For example, if the file size exceeds a certain threshold, the pipeline may trigger additional processing steps such as data validation, enrichment, or routing to different storage systems. Conversely, smaller files might be processed using a more streamlined workflow to optimize resource usage. This approach ensures that the data processing system can dynamically adapt to varying input conditions, improving efficiency and scalability in handling diverse datasets.
