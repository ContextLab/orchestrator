# Processed File

Original size: 150 bytes
Processing type: Expanded

## Result

This is a sample text file for testing conditional processing, specifically designed to validate automated pipeline behavior based on file size thresholds. It contains multiple lines of text structured to create a precise 150-byte payload that serves as a boundary condition test case. The pipeline should process this based on its size, triggering specific processing logic that differs from handling larger or smaller files.

The 150-byte size represents a carefully chosen test parameter that likely sits at or near a critical threshold in the processing system. Many automated pipelines implement size-based routing logic, where files below certain byte counts receive lightweight processing, while larger files are directed to more robust processing mechanisms or queued for batch operations. This particular size may test the boundary between small file handling and standard processing workflows.

In software testing environments, files of this exact size serve multiple validation purposes. They verify that file size detection algorithms correctly identify and categorize input data, ensuring that conditional logic branches execute as intended. The multi-line structure tests line-by-line processing capabilities while maintaining the precise byte count necessary for threshold testing.

The text content itself is deliberately generic and non-complex, focusing attention on the size-based processing logic rather than content complexity. This approach isolates the size-conditional behavior from other processing variables, enabling developers to verify that their pipeline correctly implements size-based decision trees, handles file boundaries appropriately, and maintains consistent processing behavior across different file size categories in production environments.
