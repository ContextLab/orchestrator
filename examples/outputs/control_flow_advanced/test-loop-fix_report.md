## Final Text Used for Translation
Okay, here are several improved versions of "Test loop fix," catering to different levels of detail and purpose, based on your thorough analysis. I'll include explanations of why I made the changes.  I've grouped them by how much they expand on the original.

**1. Minimal Improvement (Slightly More Descriptive - Still Commit Message Friendly)**

*   **Fixed test loop** - *Why:* Adding "Fixed" clarifies the action taken.  It's still very concise and fits a commit message format.  The word order is slightly more natural.

**2. Moderate Improvement (More Clarity, Still Concise - Good for Issue Titles/Changelog)**

*   **Fixed looping test** - *Why:* Similar to above, but "looping test" is slightly clearer than "test loop" as it directly implies the test *contains* the loop.
*   **Corrected test loop logic** - *Why:* Uses slightly more formal language ("corrected" instead of "fixed") and clarifies that the problem was with the logic of the loop.
*   **Resolved test loop issue** - *Why:* "Resolved" is a common term in issue tracking systems. "Issue" is more generic than "fix," covering a broader range of problems.

**3. More Detailed Options (Suitable for Changelogs, Documentation, or More Detailed Commit Messages)**

*   **Fixed logic error in test loop** - *Why:*  Specifies the *type* of error, making the fix more understandable.
*   **Corrected infinite test loop** - *Why:* If the loop was infinite, this is a much more specific and useful description.
*   **Improved test loop performance** - *Why:* If the fix wasn's strictly a bug fix, but an optimization, this is appropriate.
*   **Fixed test loop to handle [specific condition]** - *Why:* This is a template. Replace `[specific condition]` with the actual condition that the fix addressed. This is excellent for conveying the scope of the change.
*   **Refactored test loop for improved readability and maintainability** - *Why:* If the change wasn't just a bug fix, but a broader improvement to the code's structure.

**4. Most Detailed (For Documentation/Detailed Commit Messages - Rare, but Possible)**

*   "The test loop was exhibiting [brief description of
