*“Ocean acidification threatens marine ecosystems”*

---

**1. Overview and Interpretation**

This statement makes a scientific claim: that ocean acidification poses a threat to marine ecosystems. It succinctly connects a specific environmental phenomenon (“ocean acidification”) to a broad ecological consequence (“threatens marine ecosystems”).

---

**2. Key Concepts Explained**

- **Ocean Acidification:**  
  This refers to the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused primarily by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. When CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which lowers pH and alters the chemical balance of the ocean.

- **Marine Ecosystems:**  
  These are communities of organisms (from microscopic plankton to large mammals) living together in oceanic environments, interacting with each other and with their physical surroundings (water, seabed, etc.).

---

**3. Mechanisms of Impact**

- **Chemical Changes:**  
  Increased CO₂ leads to lower pH and reduced carbonate ion availability. Many marine organisms (e.g., corals, mollusks, some plankton) rely on carbonate ions to build shells and skeletons.

- **Biological Effects:**  
  - **Calcifying Organisms:** Organisms such as corals, oysters, and some plankton can struggle to form and maintain shells/skeletons, leading to weakened structures or increased mortality.
  - **Food Web Disruption:** If foundational species are affected, entire food webs can be destabilized. For example, pteropods (tiny sea snails) are a key food source for fish, whales, and birds.
  - **Behavioral Changes:** Some fish and invertebrates exhibit altered behaviors in more acidic conditions, such as impaired predator avoidance or navigation.

- **Ecosystem-Level Consequences:**  
  - **Coral Reefs:** Ocean acidification, combined with warming, contributes to coral bleaching and reef degradation, reducing biodiversity and ecosystem services (like coastal protection and fisheries).
  - **Fisheries:** Economically important species (e.g., shellfish) may decline, impacting livelihoods and food security.

---

**4. Examples**

- **Great Barrier Reef:**  
  Studies have shown reduced calcification rates in corals, making them more vulnerable to erosion and storms.
- **Pacific Northwest Oyster Industry:**  
  Acidified waters have led to massive die-offs in oyster larvae, threatening local economies.
- **Pteropods in the Southern Ocean:**  
  Observed shell dissolution in natural populations, with potential knock-on effects for salmon and other predators.

---

**5. Broader Implications**

- **Biodiversity Loss:**  
  As marine species struggle to adapt, some may go extinct, reducing overall biodiversity.
- **Human Societies:**  
  Impacts on fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection have significant economic and social ramifications.
- **Climate Feedback:**  
  Disrupted marine ecosystems may affect carbon cycling and storage, potentially influencing climate regulation.

---

**6. Conclusion**

The text, though brief, encapsulates a significant and pressing environmental issue. Ocean acidification, driven by human-induced CO₂ emissions, poses a multifaceted threat to marine ecosystems, affecting organism health, ecosystem stability, and human interests. Addressing this threat requires reducing CO₂ emissions and increasing resilience in marine management strategies.
