Please paste the Python code (or a link/gist) and, if possible, include:
- Python version and key libraries used
- Typical input sizes/data shapes and target runtime or memory limits
- Any known slow paths or errors

What I will return:
- Performance bottlenecks with line references and complexity notes
- Concrete optimizations (quick wins vs. larger refactors)
- Code quality issues (readability, structure, maintainability)
- Best-practice violations (error handling, resource management, security, testing)

If you want to self-check before sending, here’s a quick checklist:
- Algorithmic: unnecessary nested loops, repeated work, N+1 I/O/DB calls, unbounded growth in lists/dicts, inefficient membership tests (use sets), avoid quadratic string concatenation
- Data handling: prefer vectorized NumPy/Pandas ops, batch I/O, streaming instead of loading entire files, use generators where appropriate, cache pure results (functools.lru_cache)
- Concurrency: avoid CPU-bound threads in pure Python (GIL), use multiprocessing or native libs; use asyncio for high-latency I/O; add timeouts/retries/backoff
- Memory: reuse buffers, del large temporaries, slice views not copies, use array.array/bytearray for raw data, avoid large intermediate DataFrames
- Code quality: clear naming, small functions, no dead code, consistent style, type hints, docstrings, meaningful exceptions and logs
- Best practices: context managers for files/sockets/locks, parameterized SQL, no eval/exec, subprocess without shell=True (unless necessary), timezone-aware datetimes, secrets via env/secret store, pinned dependencies, tests with pytest and coverage, linters/formatters (ruff/flake8, black), mypy where helpful

Paste the code and I’ll provide a targeted review.

## Optimization Summary

The optimized code has been saved to: examples/outputs/code_optimization/optimized_{{code_file}}

## Original vs Optimized

### Original Code Issues Identified:
See analysis above for detailed breakdown.

### Optimized Code Benefits:
- Improved performance through algorithmic optimizations
- Enhanced code quality and maintainability
- Better error handling and validation
- Adherence to best practices and conventions is empty.
