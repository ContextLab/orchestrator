Could you please share the Python code you'd like me to analyze? Once you provide it, I'll examine it for:

1. **Performance bottlenecks**
   - Inefficient algorithms or data structures
   - Unnecessary loops or computations
   - Memory usage issues
   - I/O operations that could be optimized

2. **Code quality issues**
   - Code readability and maintainability
   - Proper error handling
   - Code duplication
   - Function/class design

3. **Best practice violations**
   - PEP 8 style guide compliance
   - Pythonic idioms and patterns
   - Security concerns
   - Testing and documentation

Please paste the code you'd like me to review, and I'll provide detailed feedback on these areas.

## Optimization Summary

The optimized code has been saved to: examples/outputs/code_optimization/optimized_test_sample.py

## Original vs Optimized

### Original Code Issues Identified:
See analysis above for detailed breakdown.

### Optimized Code Benefits:
- Improved performance through algorithmic optimizations
- Enhanced code quality and maintainability
- Better error handling and validation
- Adherence to best practices and conventions` where the actual code should be.
