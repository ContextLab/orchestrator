Could you please share the actual Python code you'd like me to analyze? Once you provide it, I'll examine it for:

1. **Performance bottlenecks** - Areas where the code could run faster
2. **Code quality issues** - Problems with readability, maintainability, or structure
3. **Best practice violations** - Deviations from Python conventions and standards

Please paste the code, and I'll provide a detailed analysis with specific recommendations for improvements.

## Optimization Summary

The optimized code has been saved to: examples/outputs/code_optimization/optimized_{{code_file}}

## Original vs Optimized

### Original Code Issues Identified:
See analysis above for detailed breakdown.

### Optimized Code Benefits:
- Improved performance through algorithmic optimizations
- Enhanced code quality and maintainability
- Better error handling and validation
- Adherence to best practices and conventions` appears where the code should be.
