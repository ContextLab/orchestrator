**Research Depth:** comprehensive

## Executive Summary

Climate change mitigation technologies are critical in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the severity of future climate impacts. This report provides a structured analysis of key mitigation approaches spanning renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon transport, carbon capture, and nature-based solutions, alongside policy and behavioral interventions.

Renewable energy technologies—solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass—remain central to decarbonizing power generation. Wind energy has driven significant CO₂ reductions; however, emerging research (Nature Climate Change, 2025) indicates climate change may diminish wind resource reliability, necessitating enhanced energy storage and grid management solutions. The adoption of wind and solar in high-penetration regions has already produced measurable emissions declines.

Energy efficiency and conservation strategies, including efficient appliances, building retrofits, and smart grids, continue to deliver rapid emissions reductions and cost-effective returns. Electrification and low-carbon transport, exemplified by exponential growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe and China post-2021—spurred by policies and infrastructure investments—represent vital mitigation pathways. Hydrogen fuel cells and public transit improvements further complement decarbonization efforts.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies have expanded, with over 30 large-scale facilities operational worldwide by 2025, collectively capturing more than 40 million tonnes of CO₂ annually. Despite progress, debates persist regarding CCUS’s scalability, economic viability, and potential to delay fossil fuel phase-out. Negative emissions solutions, such as afforestation and direct air capture (DAC), show promise; large-scale reforestation in the Amazon and Sub-Saharan Africa has sequestered millions of tonnes of CO₂, yet DAC faces challenges due to high costs and energy demands.

Policy instruments—including carbon pricing, emissions trading, and regulatory standards—combined with enhanced consumer engagement and behavioral interventions, have proven crucial in accelerating mitigation uptake. Recent findings highlight the importance of integrating behavioral science to drive sustainable consumption patterns.

In conclusion, effective climate mitigation requires a multifaceted approach combining technological innovation, robust policy frameworks, and behavioral change. Ongoing research underscores the necessity for adaptive strategies, particularly as climate variability influences the reliability of renewable resources. Addressing uncertainties around CCUS and scaling negative emissions technologies will be pivotal for achieving global climate targets.
