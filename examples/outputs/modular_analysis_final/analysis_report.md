## Statistical Analysis Summary

### Data Characteristics
The dataset contains 1,000 records across 16 columns. Key metrics show:
- **Sales/Units Sold**: Mean of 140.8 units (identical values, range 62-248)
- **Revenue**: Mean of $22,029 with high variability (std: $18,578, range $829-$104,013)
- **Average Price**: Mean of $156.52 with significant spread (std: $124.64, range $10.12-$499.35)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Mean of 2.97 on 1-5 scale, indicating below-average satisfaction
- **Conversion Rate**: Low at 2.98% average (range 1-5%)

### Critical Relationships
Two perfect/strong correlations dominate:
- **Sales and Units Sold**: Perfect correlation (r=1.0) - these are identical metrics
- **Revenue and Average Price**: Very strong correlation (r=0.944) - revenue is primarily driven by pricing, not volume

Weaker but notable relationships:
- **Sales and Revenue**: Moderate correlation (r=0.240)
- **Return Rate and Units Sold**: Weak positive correlation (r=0.074)

### Key Business Insights
- **Pricing Strategy Impact**: Revenue success depends heavily on price positioning rather than sales volume
- **Customer Experience Gap**: Below-average satisfaction (2.97/5) combined with 5.3% return rate suggests quality/service issues
- **Volume vs. Value Trade-off**: Despite consistent unit sales (~141), revenue varies dramatically ($829-$104K), indicating significant price differentiation across products/segments
- **Marketing Efficiency**: Weak correlation between marketing spend and conversion rates (r=-0.062) suggests potential optimization opportunities
