I don't see the actual document content or the results from the fact-checking analysis you referenced. The original document field shows "None" and the claims analysis, reference verification, and new citations sections contain placeholder text rather than actual data.

To help you update the document properly, I would need:

1. **The original document text** that needs to be updated
2. **The claims analysis results** showing which statements need citations
3. **The reference verification results** identifying broken or problematic references
4. **The new citations** that should be added to support unreferenced claims

Could you please provide:
- The actual document content
- The specific claims that need citations
- Any broken reference URLs that need fixing
- The new source citations you'd like me to incorporate

Once I have this information, I can help you create a properly formatted document with:
- Consistent footnote formatting
- All claims properly cited
- Fixed references
- A complete bibliography at the end

Please share the actual content and I'll be happy to help you update it comprehensively.
