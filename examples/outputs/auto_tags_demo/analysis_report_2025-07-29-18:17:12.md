## Distribution Plan

I'd be happy to help you determine the report distribution, priority level, and follow-up actions. However, I need more information about the specific trends and anomalies you've identified in your analysis.

Could you please provide:
- What type of data or metrics you analyzed
- What specific trends you discovered
- What anomalies were detected
- The business context or domain (e.g., sales, operations, security, etc.)

Once I have these details, I can provide specific recommendations for:
1. The appropriate stakeholder groups who should receive the report
2. The correct priority level based on the severity and impact of findings
3. Actionable follow-up items tailored to your situation

Please share the key findings from your analysis so I can give you the most relevant guidance.
