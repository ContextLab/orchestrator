I don't see the actual content of the document or the analysis results in your message. It appears you're using placeholder variables (None, <orchestrator.core.template_manager.TemplateManager.register_context.<locals>.ResultWrapper object at 0x144d76450>, etc.) that haven't been populated with actual data.

To help you update the document properly, I would need:

1. **The original document content** - the actual text that needs updating
2. **Claims analysis results** - which claims need citations
3. **Reference verification results** - which URLs are broken or need fixing
4. **New citations** - the sources you want to add

Could you please provide the actual document content and analysis results? Once I have that information, I can:

- Add proper citations for unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken reference links
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document

Please share the actual content and I'll be happy to help you create a properly cited and formatted document.
