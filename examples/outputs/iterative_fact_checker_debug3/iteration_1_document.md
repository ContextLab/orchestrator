I notice that the original document content and the supporting analysis (claims analysis, reference verification results, and new citations) appear to be placeholder text rather than actual content. 

To properly update a document with citations and fix broken references, I would need:

1. **The actual original document text**
2. **The specific claims that need citations** (from the claims analysis)
3. **The verification results** showing which references are broken
4. **The new citations** with their sources and URLs

Could you please provide:
- The actual document content you'd like me to update
- The list of unreferenced claims that need citations
- The broken reference URLs that need fixing
- The new source citations you'd like me to add

Once I have this information, I'll be happy to:
- Add proper footnote citations for all unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken reference URLs
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document

Please share the actual content and I'll get started on the updates right away.
