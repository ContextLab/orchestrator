I notice that the original document content and the supporting analysis (claims analysis, reference verification results, and new citations) appear to be placeholder text rather than actual content. 

To properly update a document with citations and fix references, I would need:

1. **The actual original document text**
2. **The claims analysis results** showing what statements need citations
3. **The reference verification results** indicating which URLs are broken
4. **The new citations to add** with proper source information

Could you please provide:
- The actual document content you'd like me to update
- The specific claims that need citations
- Any broken reference URLs that need fixing
- The new source materials to cite

Once I have this information, I'll be happy to:
- Add proper footnote citations for all unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken reference links
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document

Please share the actual content and analysis results, and I'll provide a thoroughly updated document with proper citations and formatting.
