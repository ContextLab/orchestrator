## Overview
AI alignment is the subfield of AI safety focused on ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human values and intentions.

## Key Findings
1. AI alignment involves designing AI systems to behave in ways that are consistent with human goals, values, and safety requirements (Sources 1, 4, 5).
2. As AI becomes more capable, the importance and challenges of alignment grow, requiring increasingly effective safety methods (Source 2).
3. Some experts argue that alignment alone may not be sufficient for AI safety, suggesting the need for broader considerations beyond just aligning with human values (Source 3).

## Summary
AI alignment seeks to encode human values and goals into AI systems to ensure they act safely and reliably as they become more advanced. While alignment is a key focus within AI safety, experts emphasize that additional safeguards may be necessary. The field continues to evolve as the capabilities and risks of AI systems increase.
