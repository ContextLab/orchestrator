## Overview

Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter that makes up about 27% of the universeâ€™s mass-energy content, yet it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects.

## Key Findings

1. Dark matter was first theorized to explain anomalies in galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing, where visible matter alone could not account for observed gravitational effects.

2. Numerous candidates for dark matter have been proposed, including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos, but none have been directly detected so far.

3. Experimental searches using underground detectors, particle accelerators, and astronomical observations continue to constrain the properties and interactions of dark matter, but its true nature remains one of the biggest unsolved questions in physics.


## Summary
Dark matter plays a crucial role in the structure and evolution of the universe, yet its composition and properties remain elusive. Current research focuses on both direct and indirect detection methods, as well as theoretical models, to uncover its fundamental nature. Despite decades of effort, direct evidence for the particles that make up dark matter has not yet been found, highlighting the ongoing mystery in physics.
