## Overview
Test template rendering involves verifying how templates are processed and displayed, often using debugging tools or testing libraries.

## Key Findings
1. Helm provides commands like helm template --debug and helm install --dry-run --debug to locally test and debug chart template rendering before deploying to a cluster.
2. Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine to render templates, and there are established methods for testing which templates are rendered during a request, such as using context managers to track rendered templates.
3. Jinja2 allows for testing variables and expressions within templates, providing built-in test functionality (e.g., is defined) to help validate template logic.

## Summary
Testing template rendering can be achieved through specialized commands and libraries in popular frameworks like Helm and Flask. These tools offer debugging, tracking, and validation features to ensure templates render correctly and as expected. Both Jinja2 and Flask provide mechanisms to test template logic and rendered outputs.
