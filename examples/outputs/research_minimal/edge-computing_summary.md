## Overview

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that processes data closer to the source of generation rather than relying solely on centralized data centers.

## Key Findings

1. Edge computing reduces latency by processing data locally, leading to faster response times and improved performance for applications such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, and real-time analytics.

2. It helps alleviate bandwidth and network congestion issues by minimizing the amount of data transmitted to central servers or the cloud.

3. Security and privacy can be enhanced with edge computing since sensitive data can be processed locally, decreasing the risk associated with transmitting data over long distances.


## Summary
Edge computing is transforming the way data is handled by moving computation closer to where data is created. This approach minimizes latency, conserves bandwidth, and can improve security, making it particularly valuable for applications that require fast, local decision-making. As a result, edge computing is increasingly critical in supporting the growth of IoT and real-time digital services.
