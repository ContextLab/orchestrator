## Overview
Orchestration templates provide structured approaches to automate processes, workflows, or infrastructure deployments.

## Key Findings
1. The Orchestrator Pattern simplifies software architecture by centralizing logic, making unit testing easier and supporting clear input handling, such as with primitive types or view models (Source 1).
2. Orchestration templates, such as those in ManageEngine ADManager Plus, enable users to visually design workflows by arranging execution blocks whose subsequent actions depend on the success or failure of previous steps (Source 2).
3. The Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) format in OpenStack defines a specification for describing infrastructure as code, allowing users to automate the deployment and management of cloud resources with example-driven guidance (Source 5).

## Summary
The sources highlight how orchestration templates streamline automation by centralizing workflow logic, supporting testability, and providing visual or code-driven tools for process definition. Both software architecture and cloud infrastructure benefit from these templates, which enable modular, reusable, and easily managed workflows. Overall, orchestration templates enhance automation, reliability, and maintainability across various domains.
