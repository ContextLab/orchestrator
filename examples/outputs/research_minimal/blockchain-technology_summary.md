## Overview

Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system that securely links records (blocks) using cryptographic hashes, enabling transparent and tamper-resistant transaction recording.

## Key Findings

1. Each block in a blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, forming a secure and chronological chain of information.

2. Blockchains are managed by decentralized peer-to-peer networks that use consensus algorithms to validate and add new transaction blocks, making alterations highly resistant and ensuring transparency.

3. Blockchain technology was first implemented in Bitcoin to solve the double-spending problem without a central authority and has since inspired various applications in cryptocurrencies and business networks.


## Summary
Blockchain technology enables secure, transparent, and decentralized recording of transactions through cryptographically linked blocks. Its design makes tampering with recorded data highly difficult and eliminates the need for a trusted central authority. Originally developed for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has since found broader applications in both public and private sectors.
