2. These techniques focus on protecting the environment, expanding the Earth's natural resource base, and ensuring that farming can be continued over time without causing damage.
3. Additional approaches such as integrated pest management and soil conservation are employed to promote soil health and prevent resource depletion.

## Summary
Sustainable agriculture uses a variety of techniques—including crop rotation, agroforestry, and integrated pest management—to maintain soil health and protect the environment. These practices seek to ensure long-term agricultural productivity while conserving natural resources. The main goal is to farm in ways that are ecologically viable and can be sustained for future generations.
