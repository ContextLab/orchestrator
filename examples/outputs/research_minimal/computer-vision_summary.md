## Overview
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world.

## Key Findings
1. Computer vision involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images or videos to extract meaningful information.
2. It utilizes models from geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory to transform visual data into numerical or symbolic representations that can guide decisions and actions.
3. Applications of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object and event detection, activity recognition, video tracking, and more, spanning inputs such as images, videos, 3D scans, and point clouds.

## Summary
Computer vision allows machines to emulate human visual comprehension, analyzing images and videos to pull actionable data. It combines theoretical and technological approaches to extract and process information from diverse visual sources. This capability underpins a range of AI-driven applications, from object detection to 3D modeling.
