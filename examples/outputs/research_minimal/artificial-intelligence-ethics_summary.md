2. Emerging challenges include ensuring AI safety and alignment, preventing misuse in areas like autonomous weaponry and misinformation, and considering the potential moral status or rights of advanced AI systems.
3. Ethical frameworks and perspectives, such as the three laws of robotics or psychological approaches, are explored to balance innovation with responsibility and to navigate the complex moral landscape introduced by AI.

## Summary
The ethics of artificial intelligence involves a wide array of concerns ranging from bias and fairness in algorithms to the societal impact of autonomous systems and potential existential risks. Addressing these challenges requires careful consideration of both current applications and future developments, as well as the creation of robust ethical guidelines to ensure responsible AI innovation.
