## Overview
Quantum computing utilizes quantum mechanical phenomena to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers.

## Key Findings
1. Quantum computers exploit superposition and entanglement, enabling them to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers (Wikipedia, IBM).
2. Current quantum hardware is largely experimental and requires special conditions, such as cooling qubits to extremely low temperatures (Wikipedia, DOE).
3. Quantum computing is expected to impact fields like cryptography, physics simulations, and high-performance computing, with companies and labs actively developing new technologies (Wikipedia, IBM, Quantum Computing Inc, DOE).

## Summary
Quantum computing is an emerging technology that leverages unique quantum mechanical properties to tackle complex computational problems. While practical quantum computers are still in the experimental stage, ongoing efforts by technology companies and research institutions are rapidly advancing the field. If scalable, quantum computers could outperform classical machines in specific areas such as encryption and scientific modeling.
