## Overview
Climate change mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to clean energy sources.

## Key Findings
1. Mitigation strategies focus on reducing the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by increasing the use of renewable energy and adopting new technologies like electric vehicles.
2. Efforts to mitigate climate change also include actions such as conserving energy and water, electrifying homes and transportation, and changing transportation methods to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3. Mitigation is not only about reducing emissions but also about creating new economic opportunities and minimizing the negative impacts of fossil energy use.

## Summary
Climate change mitigation strategies are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by adopting renewable energy sources and new technologies. These efforts include both individual actions, like conserving energy and water, and broader economic changes that create new jobs and reduce fossil fuel dependency. Overall, the goal is to decrease the environmental impact while fostering economic growth and stability.
