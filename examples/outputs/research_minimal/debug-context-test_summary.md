## Overview
Running and debugging tests in context refers to executing or troubleshooting tests directly from the code editor, often based on the cursor's position or selection.

## Key Findings
1. Visual Studio and similar IDEs provide features to run or debug tests 'in context,' allowing users to execute tests from the current location in the code editor (Source 1).
2. Some frameworks and tools, like Chainlit, require providing a specific 'context' to the test suite to properly test or debug application functions (Source 3).
3. Various development environments, such as Visual Studio Code and JetBrains Rider, offer built-in support and shortcuts for running, debugging, and testing code, streamlining the development workflow (Sources 4 and 5).

## Summary
Running and debugging tests in context is a feature supported by multiple IDEs and frameworks, enabling developers to execute or troubleshoot tests directly from where they are working in the code. This approach often involves passing the appropriate context to the test environment. Such features enhance productivity and make the testing and debugging process more efficient.
