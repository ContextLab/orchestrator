## Overview

Behavioral economics studies how psychological, cognitive, and emotional factors influence economic decision-making.

## Key Findings

1. Traditional economics assumes people act rationally, but behavioral economics reveals that biases and heuristics often lead to irrational choices.

2. Key concepts include loss aversion, framing effects, and the influence of social norms on financial decisions.

3. Behavioral interventions, such as nudges, can be used to guide people toward better choices without restricting their freedom.


## Summary
Behavioral economics challenges the assumption of rational actors in classical economics by demonstrating that real-world decisions are frequently shaped by cognitive biases and social influences. This field has led to practical applications, such as nudges, which help individuals make improved decisions in areas like finance and health. Overall, behavioral economics provides a more realistic understanding of how people behave in economic contexts.
