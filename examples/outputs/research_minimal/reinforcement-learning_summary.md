## Overview
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Key Findings
1. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in that it does not require labelled input-output pairs, instead focusing on learning through trial and error and balancing exploration and exploitation.
2. The environment in reinforcement learning is often modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and RL algorithms are designed to solve problems where the exact mathematical model may not be known or feasible to compute.
3. Reinforcement learning is considered one of the closest forms of machine learning to the way humans and animals learn, and it underpins many recent advances in training intelligent agents, including deep reinforcement learning approaches.

## Summary
Reinforcement learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through reward-based feedback rather than explicit supervision. By leveraging trial and error in dynamic environments, RL has become foundational for developing intelligent systems capable of complex decision-making. Its principles are central to recent advancements in artificial intelligence, especially in fields requiring adaptive, sequential decision processes.
