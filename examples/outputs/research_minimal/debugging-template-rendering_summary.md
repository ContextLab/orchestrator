## Overview
Debugging templates involves techniques to identify and resolve issues in template rendering across various platforms and frameworks.

## Key Findings
1. Wikipedia outlines strategies for debugging Wikipedia templates, focusing on problems in wikitext structure.
2. Helm documentation explains that debugging Helm templates can be challenging due to possible rejections by the Kubernetes API for reasons other than formatting errors.
3. Frameworks like Django (via PyCharm), Terraform, and Drupal provide specific tools or recommendations for debugging templates, such as breakpoints in Django templates, issue tracking in Terraform, and enabling Twig debug mode in Drupal, though some methods can impact site functionality or testing.

## Summary
The resources highlight that debugging templates often requires specialized tools or debugging modes tailored to each platform, such as breakpoints, debug flags, or manual inspection. Challenges include distinguishing between syntax and rendering errors as well as potential side effects when enabling debug features. Effective debugging improves template reliability but may require careful handling to avoid impacting production environments.
