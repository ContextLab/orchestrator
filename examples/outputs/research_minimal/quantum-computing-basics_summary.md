## Overview
Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical phenomena to perform computation in ways that differ fundamentally from classical computers.

## Key Findings
1. Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, where properties like energy and angular momentum are quantized, meaning they exist in discrete units called quanta.
2. Quantum computers exploit unique quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, enabling them to process information in ways that classical computers cannot.
3. The outcomes of quantum computations are inherently probabilistic due to the nature of quantum measurements, offering new computational possibilities but also presenting unique challenges.

## Summary
Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, where physical properties are quantized and particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. By harnessing superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can perform certain computations more efficiently than classical computers. However, their operation and results are fundamentally probabilistic, reflecting the underlying quantum nature.
