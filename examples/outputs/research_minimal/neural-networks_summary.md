## Overview
Neural networks are systems of interconnected units, called neurons, that can perform complex tasks by transmitting signals between each other.

## Key Findings
1. There are two main types of neural networks: biological neural networks, found in brains and nervous systems, and artificial neural networks, used in machine learning.
2. Artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons and are used to solve artificial intelligence problems by approximating nonlinear functions.
3. Neural networks can make decisions in ways similar to the human brain by mimicking biological neuron processes, and are prominent in both scientific research and practical machine learning applications.

## Summary
Neural networks consist of interconnected neurons that work together to handle complex tasks, either as biological entities in living organisms or as artificial models in machine learning. Artificial neural networks are inspired by biology, enabling machines to make decisions and solve complex problems. These models play a central role in artificial intelligence and are widely studied and applied in various scientific fields.
