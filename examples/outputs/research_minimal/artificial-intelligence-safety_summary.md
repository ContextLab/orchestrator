## Overview
Artificial intelligence safety is an interdisciplinary field focused on preventing accidents, misuse, or other harmful consequences from AI systems.

## Key Findings
1. AI safety addresses both technical aspects, such as alignment and robustness, and broader societal issues, including the development of norms and policies to promote safe AI deployment.
2. The field has grown rapidly, especially since 2023, as advanced generative AI models have highlighted potential risks and prompted the creation of dedicated institutions like AI Safety Institutes in the US and UK.
3. Research in AI safety spans immediate practical concerns, such as occupational safety and health, as well as long-term existential risks, with organizations like the Center for AI Safety working to reduce societal-scale dangers.

## Summary
AI safety is a rapidly expanding field responding to the risks posed by increasingly powerful AI systems, with efforts in both technical research and policy development. Recent years have seen the establishment of major AI safety institutions and a growing recognition of the need for robust safety standards. However, there is concern that safety measures are not keeping pace with advances in AI capabilities.
