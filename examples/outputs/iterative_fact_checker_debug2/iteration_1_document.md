I don't see the actual content from the referenced variables (load_document.content, extract_claims, verify_refs, and find_citations.result) in your message. These appear to be placeholders for data that should be loaded from other processes.

To help you update the document properly, I would need:

1. **The original document content** (from load_document.content)
2. **The claims analysis** showing which statements need citations
3. **Reference verification results** indicating which URLs are broken
4. **New citations to add** with the source information

Could you please provide the actual content for these variables? Once I have this information, I can:

- Add proper citations for unreferenced claims
- Fix or replace broken reference URLs  
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document

Please paste the actual document text and analysis results, and I'll be happy to help you create a properly cited and formatted version.
