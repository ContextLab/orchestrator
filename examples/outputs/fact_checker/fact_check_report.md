## FACT-CHECKING REPORT: examples/data/test_article.md

## Executive Summary

Document analyzed: examples/data/test_article.md
Strictness level: moderate

Total sources identified: 2
Total claims identified: 8

## Key Information

### Sources Found

The document explicitly cites two sources:

*   **2023 McKinsey report - Transforming healthcare with AI:** Available at [https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/transforming-healthcare-with-ai](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/transforming-healthcare-with-ai).  This report is used to support the claim that AI could potentially create $150 billion in annual savings for US healthcare by 2026.
*   **Nature Medicine - AI breast cancer detection study:** Published at [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02504-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02504-3], this study highlights the improved accuracy of AI models in detecting breast cancer (94.5%) compared to human radiologists (88%).

The document also mentions a "single consulting firm's projection" about AI's involvement in 90% of clinical decisions by 2030, but this source is not identified.

### Claims Analyzed

The following claims were extracted from the document and are available for verification:

1.  AI could potentially create $150 billion in annual savings for US healthcare by 2026, according to a 2023 McKinsey report.
2.  AI models can detect breast cancer with 94.5% accuracy according to a study published in Nature Medicine.
3.  Human radiologists average 88% accuracy in breast cancer detection.
4.  The pharmaceutical industry typically takes 10-15 years to bring a new drug to market.
5.  AI-powered drug discovery platforms can reduce this timeline to 3-5 years.
6.  DeepMind's AlphaFold has predicted the structure of over 200 million proteins.
7.  IBM Watson for Oncology was discontinued in 2022.
8.  The claim that AI will be involved in 90% of clinical decisions by 2030 originates from a single consulting firm's projection rather than peer-reviewed research.



## Final Assessment

Based on the parallel verification process:

*   **Overall credibility rating:** Medium
*   **Key findings:**
    *   The claims related to cost savings (McKinsey report) and diagnostic accuracy (Nature Medicine study) are supported by credible sources. The McKinsey report is a reputable source for industry analysis, and the Nature Medicine study is a peer-reviewed publication.
    *   The claim regarding AI's involvement in 90% of clinical decisions lacks a verifiable source and should be treated with caution.  The reliance on a single, unidentified consulting firm weakens its reliability.
    *   The discontinuation of IBM Watson for Oncology is a verifiable fact that can be confirmed through news articles and IBM's announcements.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   For the claim regarding AIâ€™s involvement in 90% of clinical decisions, attempt to identify the consulting firm and retrieve their report for independent verification. If the source cannot be found or the methodology is questionable, the claim should be flagged as potentially unreliable.
    *   When citing statistics and projections, prioritize sources that are publicly available and transparent about their methodology.
    *   Cross-reference claims with multiple independent sources whenever possible to enhance accuracy and reduce bias.
