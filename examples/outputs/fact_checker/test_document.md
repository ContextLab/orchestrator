# AI in Healthcare: Key Findings

Recent studies show that artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare in significant ways. According to a 2024 report from the National Institutes of Health (https://www.nih.gov/ai-healthcare-2024), AI-powered diagnostic tools now achieve 95% accuracy in detecting skin cancer.

## Key Claims

1. Machine learning algorithms can predict hospital readmissions with 87% accuracy, as reported by Johns Hopkins Medical School (https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/ml-readmissions).

2. The FDA approved 23 AI-based medical devices in 2024, according to FDA.gov (https://www.fda.gov/ai-approvals-2024).

3. AI reduces diagnostic imaging time by 40% on average, based on research published in the Journal of Medical Imaging (https://jmi.spiedigitallibrary.org/ai-imaging-2024).
