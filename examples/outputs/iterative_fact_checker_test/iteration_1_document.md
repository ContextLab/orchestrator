I notice that the original document content and the supporting analysis (claims analysis, reference verification results, and new citations) appear to be placeholder text rather than actual content. Without the actual document text and the specific claims, reference issues, and citation sources, I cannot provide a meaningful update.

To properly help you update your document, I would need:

1. **The original document text** - the actual content that needs updating
2. **Claims analysis results** - specific claims that need citations
3. **Reference verification results** - which URLs are broken and need fixing
4. **New citations to add** - the actual sources and citation information

Could you please provide the actual document content and analysis results? Once I have that information, I'll be happy to:

- Add proper citations for unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken reference links
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document

Please share the actual content, and I'll provide a thorough update with proper academic formatting.
