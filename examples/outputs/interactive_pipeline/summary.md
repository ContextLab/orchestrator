## Business Insights
Summary of processing performed:
- The original dataset contained 15 rows of sales data.
- A "filter - high_value" was applied, so only rows meeting the high-value criterion were retained (all other rows were removed).

I don’t have the filtered result or the numeric threshold used, so I can’t state exact counts or totals. To produce the requested 2–3 sentence business insight with specific numbers, I need either (a) the filtered output (how many rows remain and their sales amounts) or (b) the definition of "high_value" (e.g., sales >= $1,000).

Example (replace numbers with your actual results):
- If the high_value filter kept 4 of the 15 rows representing $18,500 in revenue, you could say: "After filtering 15 sales records for high-value transactions, 4 records remained (27% of the original dataset) totaling $18,500. These high-value sales account for X% of total revenue, indicating that a small subset of transactions drives a disproportionate share of revenue and should be prioritized for retention and upsell efforts."

Send me the filtered data or the threshold and I will produce an exact, specific 2–3 sentence insight.
