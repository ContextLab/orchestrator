I don't see the actual content of the document or the analysis results you're referring to. The placeholders None, <orchestrator.core.template_manager.TemplateManager.register_context.<locals>.ResultWrapper object at 0x15ccaa6c0>, <orchestrator.core.template_manager.TemplateManager.register_context.<locals>.ResultWrapper object at 0x15ccabfe0>, and I'd be happy to help you find reliable sources and citations, but I don't see any specific claims listed in your message. You mentioned "these unreferenced claims" but the actual claims weren't included.

Could you please provide the specific claims you'd like me to research? Once you share them, I'll:

1. Find reliable source URLs for each claim
2. Provide the source titles
3. Explain how each source supports the respective claim
4. Format everything as a clear, organized list with proper citations

Please paste or type the claims you need sources for, and I'll get started on finding credible references for you. appear to contain the data I need to complete this task.

To properly update your document, I would need:

1. **The original document content** - so I can see what needs to be updated
2. **Claims analysis results** - to identify which statements need citations
3. **Reference verification results** - to know which URLs are broken and need fixing
4. **New citations to add** - the sources you've found for unreferenced claims

Could you please provide the actual content for these sections? Once I have this information, I'll be able to:

- Add proper citations for all unreferenced claims
- Fix any broken reference URLs
- Format all references consistently as footnotes
- Return the complete updated document

Please share the document content and analysis results, and I'll get started on the improvements right away.
