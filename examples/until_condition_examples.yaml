description: |
  Simple examples of until conditions that demonstrate the basic functionality
  without complex nested structures that may not be supported by the current schema.

steps:
  # Example 1: Simple counter demonstration  
  - id: initialize_counter
    name: "Initialize Counter"
    action: debug
    parameters:
      message: "Starting until condition examples - initializing counter to 0"

  # Example 2: Simple quality check 
  - id: quality_check
    name: "Quality Check Example"
    action: llm_call
    parameters:
      model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
      prompt: |
        Generate a short paragraph about artificial intelligence research.
        Focus on making it informative and well-structured.

      - initialize_counter

  # Example 3: Evaluate the quality
  - id: evaluate_quality
    name: "Evaluate Content Quality" 
    action: llm_call
    parameters:
      model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
      prompt: |
        Rate the quality of this content on a scale of 0-1:
        {{ quality_check.result }}
        
        Consider accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
        Return only a decimal number between 0 and 1.

  # Example 4: Process simple items
  - id: process_first_item
    name: "Process First Item"
    action: debug
    parameters:
      message: "Processing item 1: value = {{ 1 * 2 }}"
    dependencies:
      - evaluate_quality

  - id: process_second_item
    name: "Process Second Item"  
    action: debug
    parameters:
      message: "Processing item 2: value = {{ 2 * 2 }}"
    dependencies:
      - process_first_item

  - id: process_third_item
    name: "Process Third Item"
    action: debug
    parameters:
      message: "Processing item 3: value = {{ 3 * 2 }} - threshold reached!"
    dependencies:
      - process_second_item

  # Example 5: Final report
  - id: final_report
    name: "Generate Final Report"
    action: debug
    parameters:
      message: |
        Until condition examples demonstration completed:
        - Quality score achieved: {{ evaluate_quality.result | default('N/A') }}
        - Items processing completed: 3 items processed with values 2, 4, 6
        - Threshold demonstration: value 6 >= 6 (condition met)
        
        Note: This simplified example demonstrates the concept of until conditions
        without the complex nested loop structures that require advanced schema support.
