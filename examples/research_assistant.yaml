steps:
  # Step 1: Analyze the research query
  - id: analyze_query
    action: |
      analyze the research query "{{query}}" with context "{{context}}" and generate:
      1. Refined search terms for web searching
      2. Key research objectives
      3. Expected types of sources (academic, news, technical, etc.)
      4. Focus areas and subtopics to explore
      cache_results: true
    
    timeout: 10.0
    tags: ["analysis", "query-processing"]

  # Step 2: Conduct web search
  - id: web_search
    action: |
      search the web for information about {{query}} using the search terms from {{analyze_query.result}} and find up to {{max_sources}} high-quality sources
      depends_on: [analyze_query]
    
    on_error:
      action: |        use alternative search strategies or reduce the number of sources      continue_on_error: true
      retry_count: 2
    timeout: 30.0
    tags: ["search", "data-collection"]

  # Step 3: Extract content from sources
  - id: extract_content
    action: |
      extract and clean the main content from the web sources found in the search results: {{web_search.result}}
      depends_on: [web_search]
    
    timeout: 20.0
    tags: ["extraction", "data-processing"]

  # Step 4: Analyze source credibility
  - id: analyze_credibility
    action: |
      analyze the credibility and reliability of the extracted sources based on:
      1. Domain authority and reputation
      2. Author credentials
      3. Publication date and relevance
      4. Content quality and depth
      5. Citations and references
      Extracted content: {{extract_content.result}}
      Return a credibility score (0-1) for each source
      depends_on: [extract_content]
    
    tags: ["analysis", "quality-control"]

  # Step 5: Filter reliable sources
  - id: filter_sources
    action: |
      filter sources with credibility score >= {{quality_threshold}} and organize by relevance to {{query}}
     depends_on: [analyze_credibility]
    cache_results: true
    tags: ["filtering", "quality-control"]

  # Step 6: Synthesize information
  - id: synthesize_findings
    action: |
      synthesize information from all reliable sources about {{query}} and extract:
      1. Key findings and insights
      2. Common themes and patterns
      3. Contradictions or debates
      4. Supporting evidence
      5. Knowledge gaps
      Organize findings by importance and relevance
      depends_on: [filter_sources]
    
    condition: "{{filter_sources.result}} != null"
    timeout: 60.0
    tags: ["synthesis", "analysis"]

  # Step 7: Generate research report
  - id: generate_report
    action: |
      create a comprehensive research report about {{query}} including:
      1. Executive summary (2-3 paragraphs)
      2. Introduction and research objectives
      3. Key findings organized by theme
      4. Supporting evidence with proper citations
      5. Analysis and insights
      6. Limitations and knowledge gaps
      7. Recommendations for further research
      8. References in APA format
      Format as professional markdown
      depends_on: [synthesize_findings]
    
    on_error:
      action: |        generate a simplified report with available information      continue_on_error: true
      fallback_value: "Unable to generate complete report - see partial results"
    timeout: 45.0
    tags: ["report", "output"]

  # Step 8: Generate PDF
  - id: export_pdf
    action: |
      convert the markdown report to a professional PDF with:
      - Title: "Research Report: {{query}}"
      - Author: "Orchestrator Research Assistant"
      - Table of contents
      - Proper formatting and styling
      Save to reports/research_{{query}}_{{execution.timestamp}}.pdf
      depends_on: [generate_report]
    
    condition: "{{generate_report.success}} == true"
    tags: ["export", "output"]

  # Step 9: Quality assurance
  - id: quality_check
    action: |
      evaluate the quality of the research report based on:
      1. Completeness of coverage
      2. Accuracy of information
      3. Clarity of presentation
      4. Proper citation of sources
      5. Relevance to original query
      Return quality score (0-1) and improvement suggestions
      depends_on: [generate_report]
    
    tags: ["validation", "quality-control"]

  # Step 10: Save to markdown file
  - id: save_to_file
    action: |
      Write the following content to a markdown file at examples/output/research_{{query | replace(' ', '_') | lower}}.md:
      
      # Research Report: {{query}}
      
      *Generated on: {{execution.timestamp}}*
