# Issue #36 Analysis and Progress

## Objective
Find and correct all fake tests. Replace mocked objects, placeholder tests, simulated tests with real implementations: real API calls (calling openai, claude, search, etc), use real sample inputs, actually create files and check them, manually verify the quality of outputs, etc.

## Current Status from Comments
- Total files to review: 201
- Files reviewed so far: ~130/201 (65%)
- Issues created: 93 (#37-#93)

## Key Comments Analysis

### Comment 1: Original Checklist
- Contains full list of 201 files to review
- Shows checkmarks (✅) for clean files
- Shows warnings (⚠️) for files with issues
- Progress shown as 74/201 initially

### Comment 2: Issue Tracking
- Tracks all issues created (#37-#93)
- Issues #37-#52 created in earlier sessions
- Issues #53-#93 created in recent sessions

### Comment 3: Progress Summary Session 1
- First 10 files reviewed
- Key finding: Many "real" tests actually use mocks
- Even source code contains mock data (sandboxed_executor.py)

### Comment 4: Progress Updates
Multiple updates showing:
- 25/201 files (12.4%)
- 44/201 files (22%)
- 74/201 files (37%)
- 91/201 files (45%)
- 130/201 files (65%)

### Comment 5: Key Findings Summary
1. Source files are mostly clean (only 1 violation: research_control_system.py)
2. Test files have extensive mock usage (~75 files)
3. Integration tests are clean
4. Example test files all use mocks (14 files)
5. Snippet tests reference non-existent MockModel

## Important Issues Created

### Meta Issues:
- Issue #70: Tracking all 42 mock-using test files
- Issue #71: Non-existent MockModel references
- Issue #93: All example test files use mocks

### Critical Source File Issues:
- Issue #39: SandboxedExecutor returns mock monitoring data
- Issue #51: MCP server is simulated
- Issue #53: ResearchReportControlSystem simulates search results

## Remaining Work
1. Need to check the original checklist against current progress
2. Verify all 201 files have been reviewed
3. Update checklist with all reviewed files
4. Post final completion status
