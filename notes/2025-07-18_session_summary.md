# Session Summary - 2025-07-18

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Ollama Subprocess Hanging (Issue #22)
- Fixed the `check_ollama_installed()` function to use "which ollama" instead of "ollama --version"
- Reduced timeouts and added stderr suppression
- Fixed LazyOllamaModel to override parent methods that were causing hangs during initialization

### 2. Fixed Model Registration Errors for API Models (Issue #38)
- Set environment variables from .env file for API keys
- All API models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) now register successfully
- Total of 59 models now available in the registry

### 3. Fixed OllamaModel Async Generate Method
- Updated OllamaModel.generate() to use `asyncio.to_thread()` for synchronous requests
- Fixed the async/await mismatch that was preventing model execution

### 4. Fixed Template Resolution in YAML Compiler
- Added `_merge_defaults_with_context()` method to apply default input values
- Default values from YAML inputs section are now properly merged with user-provided context

### 5. Improved HybridControlSystem File Operation Detection
- Made file operation patterns more specific to avoid false positives
- "Write a paragraph" is now correctly identified as a model task, not a file operation

## Current Status

The orchestrator framework is now functional with:
- ✅ Real models working (no mock fallbacks)
- ✅ File operations integrated via HybridControlSystem
- ✅ Template resolution working for basic templates
- ✅ Default values from YAML inputs being applied
- ✅ API models registering successfully with environment variables

## Remaining Issues

1. **Complex Template Filters**: The `replace(' ', '_')` filter in file paths is not being resolved correctly
2. **Research Assistant Pipeline**: Not yet tested due to the complex template issue
3. **Test Coverage**: Need to test all 12 example pipelines
4. **Mock Usage in Tests**: Need to check and remove any mock usage in test files

## Key Code Changes

1. `src/orchestrator/integrations/ollama_model.py` - Made generate() properly async
2. `src/orchestrator/compiler/yaml_compiler.py` - Added default value merging
3. `src/orchestrator/control_systems/hybrid_control_system.py` - Improved file operation detection
4. `src/orchestrator/compiler/template_renderer.py` - Fixed replace filter pattern
5. `src/orchestrator/integrations/lazy_ollama_model.py` - Override parent methods to prevent hanging

## Next Steps

1. Fix the complex template filter issue for file paths
2. Test research_assistant.yaml successfully
3. Run all 12 example pipelines
4. Check test files for mock usage and replace with real implementations
