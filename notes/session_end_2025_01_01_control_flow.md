# Session End Notes - Control Flow Testing
**Date**: 2025-01-01
**Issue**: #184 - Template rendering issues in research_advanced_tools.yaml

## What Was Accomplished

### Template Rendering Fixes
1. **Fixed JIT rendering system** - Templates now render at runtime with available context
2. **Fixed ConditionalTask** to preserve tool metadata and dependencies correctly  
3. **Updated prompts** to avoid conversational language in outputs

### Control Flow Pipeline Testing
1. **control_flow_conditional** ✅ - Fixed and working correctly
2. **control_flow_for_loop** ✅ - Already working correctly
3. **control_flow_while_loop** ⚠️ - Templates render but loop doesn't iterate
4. **control_flow_dynamic** ❌ - Goto logic not working
5. **control_flow_advanced** ⚠️ - Has forward reference issues

### Key Commits
- 19b0778: Debug immediate result registration for template rendering
- d5e4463: Preserve tool metadata for conditional tasks
- 6daa1b2: Register PDF compiler and report generator tools
- 4669d49: Add filesystem write detection patterns
- a930a9d: Ensure ControlFlowCompiler passes context to pipeline builder
- b85940a: Store while loop condition in metadata
- 9d80349: Document control flow pipeline status

## Remaining Issues

### While Loop Implementation
- The `_handle_control_flow` method returns a placeholder instead of executing the loop
- The `_expand_while_loops` method exists but isn't being triggered properly
- Need to integrate while loop handler into execution flow

### Goto/Dynamic Flow
- Tasks with goto are being executed immediately instead of via jump logic
- Need proper implementation of dynamic task dependencies
- Goto handler exists but isn't integrated

### Forward References
- Some templates try to access results from tasks that haven't run yet
- Need better handling of conditional task results in templates
- May need to delay template rendering for certain contexts

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper while loop iteration logic
2. Fix goto/dynamic flow control implementation
3. Address forward reference issues in templates
4. Add tests for all control flow patterns
5. Update documentation with working examples
