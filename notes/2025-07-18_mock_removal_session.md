# Mock Removal Session - 2025-07-18

## Session Overview
This session focused on systematically removing ALL mock implementations from the Orchestrator codebase per issue #10's requirement that all functions must have real, working implementations.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Production Code Mock Removal (14/18 files fixed)

#### Core Files - COMPLETE ✅
- Removed `MockModel` class from `src/orchestrator/core/model.py` (commit: ccd4ab1)
- Removed `MockControlSystem` class from `src/orchestrator/core/control_system.py` (commit: ccd4ab1)
- Refactored `ResearchReportControlSystem` to inherit from `ControlSystem` (commit: ccd4ab1)
- Refactored `ToolIntegratedControlSystem` to inherit from `ControlSystem` (commit: ccd4ab1)
- Added `HybridControlSystem` that selects appropriate control system based on task (commit: ccd4ab1)

#### Cache System - COMPLETE ✅
- Removed `mock_mode` parameter from `RedisCache` class (commit: bcf9ea2)
- Removed all mock behavior methods (get, set, delete, clear, size, keys, batch_set, invalidate_pattern)
- Updated to use `DistributedCache` with fallback behavior

#### Comments/Documentation - COMPLETE ✅
- Updated `src/orchestrator/__init__.py` warning message (commit: bcf9ea2)
- Updated `src/orchestrator/compiler/ambiguity_resolver.py` comment (commit: bcf9ea2)
- Updated `src/orchestrator/engine/runtime_auto_resolver.py` comment (commit: bcf9ea2)
- Updated `src/orchestrator/core/cache.py` comment about Redis (commit: bcf9ea2)

#### Other Production Code - PARTIAL (1/4 fixed)
- Fixed `model_based_control_system.py` to raise exceptions instead of mock fallback (commit: 998d04d)
- Created issues for files needing implementation:
  - Issue #12: LangGraphAdapter._execute_task needs real implementation
  - Issue #13: MCPAdapter._send_message needs real MCP transport
  - Issue #14: MCPAdapter.execute_task needs real execution
  - Issue #15: SandboxedExecutor.get_monitoring_data needs real resource monitoring

### 2. Examples - COMPLETE ✅
- Updated `examples/research_control_system.py` (commit: c709530)
- Updated `examples/tool_integrated_control_system.py` (commit: c709530)
- Both now inherit from real `ControlSystem` class with proper imports

### 3. Created Mock Audit Tool
- `find_all_mocks.py` script to find all mock mentions in codebase
- Found 86 files with 1,785 total mock mentions
- 69 test files still need conversion to real API calls

## Key Learning: No Placeholders Allowed
The user made it very clear that placeholder/mock implementations are NOT acceptable:
- "mocks, placeholders, or any other temporary hack to get the toolbox to 'run' will not be sufficient"
- "placeholders and mocks don't actually DO anything"
- "everything in the toolbox needs to be functional IN PRACTICE"

When we can't implement functionality immediately, we must:
1. Create a GitHub issue for the missing implementation
2. Leave the checklist item unchecked
3. Link to the issue in the checklist

## Remaining Work

### Test Files (69 files)
All test files need conversion from mock-based testing to real API/resource testing:
- 9 integration tests
- 38 unit tests
- 13 example tests
- 8 snippet tests
- 1 declarative framework test

### Implementation Issues Created
- Issue #12: Implement real task execution in LangGraphAdapter
- Issue #13: Implement real MCP message transport
- Issue #14: Implement real MCP task execution
- Issue #15: Implement real system resource monitoring

## Important Code References

### HybridControlSystem (src/orchestrator/control_systems/hybrid_control_system.py)
```python
class HybridControlSystem(ControlSystem):
    """Hybrid control system that selects appropriate implementation based on task."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_registry: Optional[ModelRegistry] = None):
        # Intelligently selects between ResearchReportControlSystem and ToolIntegratedControlSystem
```

### RedisCache Refactoring (src/orchestrator/core/cache.py)
- Changed from mock_mode parameter to auto_fallback behavior
- Now uses DistributedCache internally
- Falls back to memory+disk cache if Redis unavailable

## Testing Philosophy
Per CLAUDE.md and issue #10:
- ALL tests must use real function calls
- Verify external APIs work correctly
- Test with real models, real databases, real connections
- No mock objects even for testing

## Next Steps
1. Begin systematic conversion of test files to use real APIs
2. Implement missing functionality for issues #12-15
3. Continue enforcing "no mocks" policy for all new code
4. Update documentation to emphasize real implementations

## Session Commands Used
- `python find_all_mocks.py` - Audit all mock usage
- `gh issue create` - Created issues #12-15
- `gh issue comment 10` - Updated issue #10 checklist multiple times

## Final Status
- Production code: 78% mock-free (14/18 files)
- Examples: 100% mock-free (2/2 files)
- Tests: 0% converted (0/69 files)
- Total mock mentions reduced from 1,785 to ~1,700
