# Test Status Report - 2025-07-23

## Summary
Significant progress has been made in fixing test failures across the orchestrator codebase.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Control Flow Engine Fixes
- **Fixed goto functionality** in dynamic flow tests
  - Improved variable replacement in template expressions
  - Fixed JavaScript to Python ternary operator conversion
  - Fixed lowercase 'true' to Python 'True' conversion
  - Implemented proper task skipping logic for goto jumps
- **Result**: All 6 control flow tests now pass

### 2. Model Registry Fixes
- Fixed missing `load_balancer` fixture
- Fixed model singleton issues with absolute imports
- Added error handling for duplicate model registration
- **Result**: Model-related tests working correctly

### 3. Pipeline Execution Fixes
- Fixed `recursion_context` parameter naming issue
- Fixed event loop closed errors with proper `asyncio.run()` usage
- Added `run_async()` method for async contexts
- **Result**: Pipeline tests execute without event loop errors

### 4. Test Expectation Fixes
- Updated test expectations to match actual pipeline step names
- Fixed web search integration test assertions
- **Result**: Integration tests pass with correct expectations

## Current Test Status

### Integration Tests (tests/integration/)
- **35 tests passed**
- **3 tests skipped**
- **0 tests failed**

### Control Flow Tests
- **6/6 tests passed**

### Known Issues
1. **AUTO tag parsing** - research-report-template.yaml has YAML parsing issues
2. **Long test execution times** - Some tests take 15+ minutes to complete
3. **Coverage remains low** - Overall coverage at ~15-19%

## Recommendations
1. Fix AUTO tag YAML parsing issue in the compiler
2. Implement test parallelization to reduce execution time
3. Add more unit tests to improve coverage
4. Consider splitting long-running integration tests

## Next Steps
1. Run linters and fix any code style issues
2. Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions
3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline for any environment-specific failures
