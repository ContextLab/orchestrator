# Implementation Progress - January 18, 2025

## Summary

Significant progress on implementing the orchestrator framework. The system can now parse YAML pipelines, execute tasks with mock models, and write output files.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fixed Jinja2 Filter Support
- Added missing `regex_search` filter to YAMLCompiler
- Added other common filters: `default`, `lower`, `upper`, `replace`
- Template engine now properly initialized with custom filters
- Commit: 5823c1e

### 2. ✅ Basic File Operations
- Implemented `save_output` and file write handling
- Control system detects file operations from action text
- Creates output directories as needed
- Basic template resolution for file paths
- Commit: 773dec6

### 3. ✅ Pipeline Execution Works
- Created `run_example_minimal.py` that bypasses hanging init
- Pipelines execute end-to-end with mock models
- All 12 examples have valid YAML structure
- Research assistant example runs successfully

## Current Issues

### 1. ❌ Runtime Template Resolution
- Step results (e.g., `{{generate_report.result}}`) don't resolve
- `previous_results` not properly passed to file write operations
- Need to fix context passing between steps

### 2. ❌ Model Initialization Hangs
- `init_models()` hangs on ollama check (subprocess timeout)
- Workaround: Use minimal script with mock models only

### 3. ⚠️ Partial Implementations
- PDF export skipped (not implemented)
- Real model integration needed
- Tool execution for non-file operations missing

## Files Created/Modified

### New Scripts
- `/run_example_minimal.py` - Minimal test runner with mock models
- `/test_example_pipeline.py` - Full test with init_models (hangs)
- `/simple_test.py` - Basic import test

### Core Changes
- `src/orchestrator/compiler/yaml_compiler.py` - Added custom filters
- `src/orchestrator/models/` - Added OpenAI/Anthropic adapters (unused)
- `examples/research_assistant.yaml` - Fixed on_error handling

## How to Test

```bash
# Run minimal test (works)
python run_example_minimal.py

# Check output
ls examples/output/
cat examples/output/research_assistant.md
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Runtime Template Resolution**
   - Pass previous_results correctly to all task handlers
   - Ensure step results are available in template context

2. **Fix Model Initialization**
   - Debug ollama subprocess hanging
   - Add timeout to subprocess calls
   - Make ollama check optional

3. **Implement Real Model Support**
   - Test with actual API keys
   - Handle async model calls properly
   - Add error handling for API failures

4. **Complete Tool Integration**
   - Web search, data processing tools
   - Terminal command execution
   - Validation and quality checks

## GitHub Issues Updated
- #4 - Template variable resolution (partially fixed)
- #8 - AUTO tag resolution (working with mock models)
