# While Loop Implementation Status

## Current State
The while loop pipeline executes but doesn't iterate. Templates render correctly but the loop completes with 0 attempts.

## What's Been Fixed
1. **Template Metadata**: While condition is now always stored in metadata
2. **Template Syntax**: Fixed invalid Jinja2 syntax in pipeline
3. **Template Rendering**: All templates render correctly with context
4. **Execution Prevention**: While loop tasks are prevented from direct execution

## Current Issue
The main Orchestrator lacks while loop expansion logic. The system is split:
- **ControlFlowCompiler**: Handles compile-time expansion (for loops) ✅
- **ControlFlowEngine**: Has runtime expansion (while loops) ✅
- **Orchestrator**: Uses ControlFlowCompiler but NOT ControlFlowEngine ❌

## Architecture Problem
1. While loop task gets marked as ready because its dependencies are satisfied
2. Control system tries to execute it, now raises error
3. No component in the main execution path handles while loop expansion

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Add While Loop Support to Orchestrator
- Add `_expand_while_loops` method to Orchestrator
- Check for while loops after each execution level
- Use WhileLoopHandler to create iteration tasks

### Option 2: Use ControlFlowEngine for Control Flow Pipelines
- Detect control flow features in pipeline
- Route to ControlFlowEngine instead of Orchestrator
- Need to fix tool/action mismatch (generate_text vs tools)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Keep using Orchestrator for most execution
- Delegate while loop expansion to ControlFlowEngine components
- Requires careful integration

## Next Steps
1. Decide on architectural approach
2. Implement while loop expansion in chosen component
3. Test with control_flow_while_loop.yaml
4. Fix control_flow_dynamic (goto logic)
5. Fix control_flow_advanced (forward references)
