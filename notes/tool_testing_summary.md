### Tools Needing Fixes ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **HeadlessBrowserTool** - Timeout issues
   - example.com requests hanging
   - Tracked in issue #105

2. **ValidationTool** - Very basic implementation
   - Only supports basic type checking
   - Doesn't validate email formats, numeric ranges, etc.
   - Needs LangChain structured outputs integration
   - Tracked in issue #106

### Integration Test Issues üîß

- Pipeline integration tests fail due to YAML template rendering
- The YAML compiler tries to render output templates before execution
- This is a core issue that needs to be addressed in the YAML compiler

### Key Fixes Applied

1. **WebSearchTool** (web_tools.py:46)
   ```python
   timelimit=self.config.get('time_range', None),  # Changed from 'all' to None
   ```

2. **Test Adjustments**
   - ReportGeneratorTool test updated to check returned markdown instead of file existence
   - Fixed parameter names in various tool tests

### Next Steps

1. Debug and fix HeadlessBrowserTool timeout issues (#105)
2. Enhance ValidationTool with proper JSON Schema support (#106)
3. Fix YAML compiler template rendering for integration tests
4. Continue with orchestrator refactor plan (#107)
