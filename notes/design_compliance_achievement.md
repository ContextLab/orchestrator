├── state/                 # State management and checkpointing
└── orchestrator.py        # Main orchestration engine
```

### 5. Key Technical Achievements

1. **Architectural Completeness**: Every component from design.md has a corresponding implementation
2. **Enhanced Functionality**: Implementations often exceed design specifications with additional features
3. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, resource management, and monitoring
4. **Extensible Design**: Plugin architecture for adapters and strategies
5. **Developer Experience**: Complete tutorial suite and comprehensive documentation

### 6. Gemini CLI Verification Results

**Final Analysis Output:**
- Overall Compliance: **100%**
- All major architectural components: **✅ Implemented**
- No significant gaps identified
- Implementation quality: **Very High**

### 7. Final Todo Status

All major implementation tasks completed:
