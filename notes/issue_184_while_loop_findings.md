# While Loop Control Flow Findings

## Issue Summary
The while loop control flow pipeline is not actually iterating. It returns a placeholder message "Control flow (while) executed" instead of creating iteration tasks.

## What We Fixed
1. **Template Metadata**: Fixed the `_process_while_loop` method in `control_flow_compiler.py` to always store the while condition in metadata (not just when it has AUTO tags).
2. **Template Syntax**: Fixed invalid Jinja2 syntax in `control_flow_while_loop.yaml`:
   - Changed `$iteration` to `guessing_loop.iteration` 
   - Fixed `guessing_loop.$iterations` to `guessing_loop.iterations`
3. **Template Rendering**: Templates now render correctly in output files (e.g., `Target number: 42` instead of `Target number: {{ target_number }}`)

## Current Status
- The pipeline runs without errors
- Templates are rendered correctly
- The while loop task completes immediately with a placeholder result
- No iterations are created
- The output shows 0 attempts and success: False

## Root Cause
The `_handle_control_flow` method in `HybridControlSystem` just returns a placeholder result instead of actually executing the while loop. The actual loop expansion should happen in the control flow engine's `_expand_while_loops` method, but it's not being triggered properly.

## What Needs to Be Done
1. The while loop handler needs to be integrated properly into the execution flow
2. The control system should not return a placeholder for while loops
3. The engine needs to check for while loop tasks and expand them iteratively (similar to how for loops work)

## Comparison with For Loops
For loops work correctly because they are expanded at compile time into individual iteration tasks. While loops need runtime expansion because the condition needs to be evaluated after each iteration.

## Next Steps
- Investigate how the for loop expansion works and apply similar logic for while loops
- Update the control system to properly handle while loop tasks
- Test the control_flow_dynamics and control_flow_advanced pipelines after fixing while loops
