# Control Flow Pipeline Testing Update

## Summary
Tested all control flow pipelines as part of issue 184. Found and fixed several issues related to template rendering and control flow execution.

## Pipeline Status

### ✅ control_flow_conditional.yaml
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Fixed**: 
  - Condition evaluation timing (conditions now evaluated at runtime with step results)
  - Updated prompts to avoid conversational language
- **Commit**: d5e4463

### ✅ control_flow_for_loop.yaml  
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Notes**: Loop expansion happens at compile time, creating individual iteration tasks

### ⚠️ control_flow_while_loop.yaml
- **Status**: Partially working
- **Fixed**:
  - Template metadata issue (while_condition now always stored)
  - Template syntax errors ($iteration -> guessing_loop.iteration)
  - Templates now render correctly in output files
- **Issue**: While loop doesn't iterate - returns placeholder "Control flow (while) executed"
- **Commit**: b85940a

### ❌ control_flow_dynamic.yaml
- **Status**: Not working
- **Issues**:
  - Tasks execute in wrong order (handlers run immediately instead of via goto)
  - Dependency AUTO tag returned boolean instead of list (fixed)
  - Goto logic not properly implemented

### ⚠️ control_flow_advanced.yaml
- **Status**: Partially working  
- **Fixed**:
  - Jinja2 syntax error ("contains" -> "in")
- **Issues**:
  - Forward reference errors (accessing enhance_text.result before it runs)
  - Template rendering errors due to execution order

## Key Findings

1. **Template Rendering**: JIT (Just-In-Time) rendering is working correctly - templates are rendered at runtime with available context.

2. **While Loops**: The control flow engine has infrastructure for while loop expansion (`_expand_while_loops`) but it's not being triggered properly. The handler returns a placeholder instead of creating iteration tasks.

3. **Goto Logic**: Dynamic flow control with goto statements needs proper implementation. Tasks with goto should not have regular dependencies.

4. **Execution Order**: Some pipelines have forward references where templates try to access results from tasks that haven't run yet.

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper while loop iteration logic
2. Fix goto/dynamic flow control 
3. Address forward reference issues in templates
4. Add comprehensive tests for all control flow patterns
