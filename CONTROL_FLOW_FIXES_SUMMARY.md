# Control Flow Advanced Pipeline - Template Rendering Fixes

## Summary

Successfully fixed template rendering issues in the `control_flow_advanced.yaml` pipeline while maintaining all control flow variety.

## Changes Made

### 1. Template Rendering Infrastructure (Issue #159)
- **Enhanced task context building** - Added flattened previous_results, execution metadata, and pipeline parameters
- **Fixed loop context inheritance** - Ensured for_each loops have access to all pipeline data
- **Improved template manager registration** - Enhanced timing and completeness of context registration
- **Added debug logging** - Comprehensive logging to track template rendering

### 2. Pipeline Structure Fixes
- **Eliminated forward references** - Removed templates that referenced not-yet-executed steps
- **Added select_text step** - Creates a concrete value for the text to be translated (either enhanced or original)
- **Used conditional templates** - Changed from `{{ enhance_text.result }}` to `{% if select_text %}{{ select_text }}{% else %}{{ input_text }}{% endif %}`
- **Fixed step result references** - Changed from `{{ step.result }}` to `{{ step }}` for direct access

## Control Flow Features Maintained

The pipeline still demonstrates all required control flow features:

1. **Conditional execution** (`if`):
   - `enhance_text` - Only runs if quality check returns "improve"
   - `create_brief_summary` - Only runs if â‰¤2 languages
   - `create_detailed_summary` - Only runs if >2 languages

2. **For-each loops** (`for_each`):
   - `translate_text` - Iterates over each language
   - Contains nested steps (translate, validate, save)
   - Uses loop variables (`$item`, `$index`)

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Complex dependency chains throughout
   - Conditional steps properly depend on their conditions
   - Loop steps depend on previous iterations when sequential

4. **Parallel execution**:
   - `max_parallel: 2` for translation loop
   - Multiple independent tasks at same level

5. **Nested operations**:
   - Translation loop contains 3 sub-steps
   - Each sub-step has its own dependencies

6. **Template expressions**:
   - Jinja2 conditionals (`{% if ... %}`)
   - Filters (`| slugify`, `| length`, `| default`)
   - Complex expressions in conditions

## Key Achievement

**AI models now receive fully rendered prompts** instead of template strings. The pipeline executes successfully with proper template rendering in model prompts.

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Conditional step references**: Templates cannot reference steps that may not run. Solution: Use conditional templates with defaults.

2. **Loop-expanded task IDs**: For_each loops create dynamic task IDs (e.g., `translate_text_0_translate`), so the parent loop ID cannot be directly referenced.

3. **Performance**: Complex pipelines with many conditional branches and API calls may take time to complete.

## Testing

The pipeline has been tested with various inputs and successfully:
- Analyzes text quality
- Conditionally enhances text
- Translates to multiple languages
- Validates translation quality  
- Saves results with proper formatting
- Creates summary reports
