## System Overview

The Pipeline Validation System is a production-grade solution
for automated validation of orchestrator pipelines. It integrates multiple
components to provide comprehensive quality assurance.

### Architecture Components
- Enhanced Validation Engine: Core validation logic with plugin architecture
- LLM Quality Review System: AI-powered output assessment
- Visual Output Validation: Image and chart validation
- Performance Monitoring: Baseline management and regression detection
- Reporting Dashboard: Executive and operational reporting
- CI/CD Integration: Two-tier validation workflow

## Monitoring

### Monitoring Dashboard Access

Access monitoring dashboards at:
- Executive Dashboard: `/Users/jmanning/orchestrator/production_output/monitoring/executive_dashboard_config.json`
- Operational Dashboard: `/Users/jmanning/orchestrator/production_output/monitoring/operational_dashboard_config.json`
- Quality Dashboard: `/Users/jmanning/orchestrator/production_output/monitoring/quality_dashboard_config.json`

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Validation success rate (target: >98%)
- Average execution time (target: <90 minutes)
- Monthly API costs (target: <$50)
- System resource utilization
- Quality score trends

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate: >5% (Critical)
- Response time: >300s (Warning)
- Monthly cost: >$60 (Warning)
- Memory usage: >90% (Warning)

## Maintenance
