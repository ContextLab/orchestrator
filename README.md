## Overview

Orchestrator is a powerful, flexible AI pipeline orchestration framework that simplifies the creation and execution of complex AI workflows. By combining YAML-based configuration with intelligent model selection and automatic ambiguity resolution, Orchestrator makes it easy to build sophisticated AI applications without getting bogged down in implementation details.

### Key Features

- üéØ **YAML-Based Pipelines**: Define complex workflows in simple, readable YAML
- ü§ñ **Multi-Model Support**: Seamlessly work with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, and HuggingFace models
- üß† **Intelligent Model Selection**: Automatically choose the best model based on task requirements
- üîÑ **Automatic Ambiguity Resolution**: Use `<AUTO>` tags to let AI resolve configuration ambiguities
- üì¶ **Modular Architecture**: Extend with custom models, tools, and control systems
- üõ°Ô∏è **Production Ready**: Built-in error handling, retries, checkpointing, and monitoring
- ‚ö° **Parallel Execution**: Efficient resource management and parallel task execution
- üê≥ **Sandboxed Execution**: Secure code execution in isolated environments
- üíæ **Lazy Model Loading**: Models are downloaded only when needed, saving disk space

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install py-orc
```

For additional features:
```bash
pip install py-orc[ollama]      # Ollama model support
pip install py-orc[cloud]        # Cloud model providers
pip install py-orc[dev]          # Development tools
pip install py-orc[all]          # Everything
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a simple pipeline** (`hello_world.yaml`):

```yaml
id: hello_world
name: Hello World Pipeline
description: A simple example pipeline

steps:
  - id: greet
    action: generate_text
    parameters:
      prompt: "Say hello to the world in a creative way!"
      
  - id: translate
    action: generate_text
    parameters:
      prompt: "Translate this greeting to Spanish: {{ greet.result }}"
    dependencies: [greet]

outputs:
  greeting: "{{ greet.result }}"
  spanish: "{{ translate.result }}"
```

2. **Run the pipeline**:

```python
import orchestrator as orc

# Initialize models (auto-detects available models)
orc.init_models()

# Compile and run the pipeline
pipeline = orc.compile("hello_world.yaml")
result = pipeline.run()

print(result)
```

### Using AUTO Tags

Orchestrator's `<AUTO>` tags let AI decide configuration details:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: analyze_data
    action: analyze
    parameters:
      data: "{{ input_data }}"
      method: <AUTO>Choose the best analysis method for this data type</AUTO>
      visualization: <AUTO>Decide if we should create a chart</AUTO>
```

## Model Configuration

Configure available models in `models.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  # Local models (via Ollama) - downloaded on first use
  - source: ollama
    name: llama3.1:8b
    expertise: [general, reasoning, multilingual]
    size: 8b
    
  - source: ollama
    name: qwen2.5-coder:7b
    expertise: [code, programming]
    size: 7b

  # Cloud models
  - source: openai
    name: gpt-4o
    expertise: [general, reasoning, code, analysis, vision]
    size: 1760b  # Estimated

defaults:
  expertise_preferences:
    code: qwen2.5-coder:7b
    reasoning: deepseek-r1:8b
    fast: llama3.2:1b
```

Models are downloaded only when first used, saving disk space and initialization time.

## Advanced Example

Here's a more complex example showing model requirements and parallel execution:

```yaml
id: research_pipeline
name: AI Research Pipeline
description: Research a topic and create a comprehensive report

inputs:
  - name: topic
    type: string
    description: Research topic
    
  - name: depth
    type: string
    default: <AUTO>Determine appropriate research depth</AUTO>

steps:
  # Parallel research from multiple sources
  - id: web_search
    action: search_web
    parameters:
      query: "{{ topic }} latest research 2025"
      count: <AUTO>Decide how many results to fetch</AUTO>
    requires_model:
      expertise: [research, web]
      
  - id: academic_search
    action: search_academic
    parameters:
      query: "{{ topic }}"
      filters: <AUTO>Set appropriate academic filters</AUTO>
    requires_model:
      expertise: [research, academic]
      
  # Analyze findings with specialized model
  - id: analyze_findings
    action: analyze
    parameters:
      web_results: "{{ web_search.results }}"
      academic_results: "{{ academic_search.results }}"
      analysis_focus: <AUTO>Determine key aspects to analyze</AUTO>
    dependencies: [web_search, academic_search]
    requires_model:
      expertise: [analysis, reasoning]
      min_size: 20b  # Require large model for complex analysis
      
  # Generate report
  - id: write_report
    action: generate_document
    parameters:
      topic: "{{ topic }}"
      analysis: "{{ analyze_findings.result }}"
      style: <AUTO>Choose appropriate writing style</AUTO>
      length: <AUTO>Determine optimal report length</AUTO>
    dependencies: [analyze_findings]
    requires_model:
      expertise: [writing, general]

outputs:
  report: "{{ write_report.document }}"
  summary: "{{ analyze_findings.summary }}"
```
